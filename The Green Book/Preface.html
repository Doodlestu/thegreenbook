                <p>The immunisation programme in the UK continues to evolve, meeting the
demand to improve the control of infectious diseases through vaccination.
Since the last edition of Immunisation against infectious disease (the Green
Book), the immunisation programme has seen a number of changes, to both
the vaccination schedule and to peoples’ attitudes to vaccination. New vaccines
have been introduced against meningococcal group C and pneumococcal
infections which are the cause of serious diseases. At the same time, as the
epidemiology of some diseases changes, certain vaccination schedules have
been altered: the school’s BCG programme has stopped and a more targeted
approach to BCG vaccination has been adopted. Other changes to the
immunisation schedule, such as the introduction of a Hib/MenC booster at 12
months of age and the reduction of MenC doses given as a primary course,
reflect the importance of diligent surveillance and clinical trials to study the
most effective way to use vaccines in the UK schedule.</p>
                
                <p> The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) continues to
play a pivotal role in advising the UK’s Health Departments, providing
independent scientific advice for the whole programme. JCVI meets three
times a year and comprises experts from many areas of medicine and clinical
practice especially related to immunisation. The members are independent of
government, work to the highest international standards as recognised by the
World Health Organization and publish their recommendations and advice,
together with those of the various sub-committees, on the Department of
Health website. </p>
                
                <p>The objectives of the national immunisation programme include providing
clear, evidence-based communications that meet the needs of parents and
health professionals, and ensuring that those working in primary care are
provided with the support required to implement vaccination programmes
effectively.</p>
                <p>Following the ill-founded MMR scare, it has become even more important for
those working in the field to be able to communicate to parents the benefits of
vaccination, the known side effects of vaccines and the safety and efficacy of
vaccines to allay fears.</p>
                
                <p>I look forward to the exciting work that lies ahead in developing an
immunisation programme that offers safe and effective protection for our
children and families both today and in the future.</p>
