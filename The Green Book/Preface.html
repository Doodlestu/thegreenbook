                <p>Since the last hard copy version of the Green Book was published, much has changed.  The National Immunisation Programme now includes yet more vaccines for children, adolescents and older people, and our access to technology has also changed greatly.  We now have mobile phones and tablets that have more computing power than was available to NASA to send men to the moon. With those advances have come greater needs for rapid access to up to date information, that can be changed easily whenever necessary, and that puts the information in a format that gives the answers that are needed without lengthy searches.  Apps do just that. I am delighted that there is now an app for the Green Book that allows everyone involved in immunisation to find the facts whenever they need them. I hope you find it useful.</p>
