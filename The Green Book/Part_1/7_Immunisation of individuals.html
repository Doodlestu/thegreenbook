                    <p>Individuals with immunosuppression and HIV infection (regardless of CD4 count) should be given inactivated vaccines in accordance with national recommendations. However, these individuals may not mount as good an antibody response as immunocompetent individuals. Therefore, wherever possible, immunisation or boosting of HIV-positive individuals should be either carried out before immunosuppression occurs or deferred until an improvement in immunity has been seen.</p>

                    <p> For individuals due to commence immunosuppressive treatments, inactivated vaccines should ideally be administered at least two weeks before commencement. In some cases this will not be possible and therefore vaccination may be carried out at any time and re-immunisation considered after treatment is finished and recovery has occurred. In the case of live vaccines, a longer period before immunosuppression commences may be desirable, but the disadvantages of delaying such treatment are often significant. Specialist advice should be sought from an appropriate physician. </p>

                        In severely immunosuppressed individuals, re-immunisation should be considered after treatment is finished and/or recovery has occurred. Specialist advice should be sought. Further guidance is provided by the RCPCH

                        <p>Some vaccines are contraindicated in immunosuppressed individuals and such individuals may not respond well to other vaccines. Therefore, to minimise the risk of infection, close contacts of immunosuppressed individuals should be fully immunised according to the UK schedule, as a matter of priority. Close contacts of severely immunosuppressed individuals should also be offered vaccination against varicella and influenza. This will reduce the risk of vulnerable individuals being exposed to the serious consequences of vaccine-preventable infections.</p>

                    <p>
                        Very premature infants (born &#8804 28 weeks of gestation) who are in hospital should have respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs when given their first immunisation, particularly those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. If the child has apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations after the first immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital, with respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs (Pfister <i>et al</i>., 2004; Ohlsson <i>et al</i>., 2004; Schulzke <i>et al</i>., 2005; Pourcyrous <i>et al</i>., 2007; Klein <i>et al</i>., 2008).

                        Additionally, individuals who receive bone marrow transplants are likely to lose any natural or immunisation-derived protective antibodies against most vaccine-preventable diseases. It is unclear whether they may acquire the donor's immunity, and therefore all individuals should be considered for a re-immunisation programme.
