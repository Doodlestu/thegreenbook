                        <p>Vaccines induce protection by eliciting active immune responses to specific antigens. There may be predictable adverse reactions (side effects): most are mild and resolve quickly. However, it is not always possible to predict individuals who might have a mild or serious reaction to a vaccine. The advice in this chapter uses the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs). It gives an overview of common side effects associated with vaccines and of the management of serious adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis. The process of vaccine safety monitoring in the UK and the reporting of suspected vaccine-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs) via the Yellow Card scheme are described in Chapter 9. </p>

                    <p>Some AEFIs can be induced by the vaccination process itself. The administration of the vaccine causes the AEFI, rather than any of the vaccine components: for example fainting in older children and adults during the 1999-2000 meningitis C immunisation campaign (Medicines Control Agency, 2000). </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Vaccine-induced AEFIs </div>
                    <p>These are reactions in individuals specifically caused by a particular vaccine or its component parts. These may be induced, direct effects of the vaccine or one of its components, and/or due to an underlying medical condition or an idiosyncratic response in the recipient. </p>
                    <p>Direct effects of vaccines include, for example, local reactions and fever within 48 hours of DTaP/IPV/Hib, rash and fever seven to ten days after MMR, and parotitis three weeks after MMR. </p>
                    <p>An example of an AEFI due to an underlying medical condition is vaccineassociated paralysis which very rarely followed the use of live attenuated oral polio vaccine in a child with previously unrecognised severe combined immune deficiency.</p>
                    <p>Idiosyncratic responses include idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP) within 30 days of MMR, and anaphylaxis immediately after vaccination. When there has been a confirmed anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of the same vaccine, then this contraindicates further vaccinations with the same vaccine or a component of that vaccine. </p>
                   
                        <p>
                            This category also includes medical conditions that would have occurred at some point in an individual but are triggered earlier by the vaccination. This may include febrile seizures in a child with a family history of the same, or onset of infantile spasms (Bellman <i>et al</i>., 1983).
                        </p>
                        <div id="thirdtitle">Coincidental AEFIs </div>
                        <p>These are not true adverse reactions to immunisations or vaccines but are only linked because of the timing of their occurrence. When an AEFI is coincidental, the event would have occurred even if the individual had not been immunised. An example would be people who develop a cold with coryzal symptoms following flu vaccination. Flu vaccine does not prevent the common cold and colds are common in the winter when people are receiving flu vaccine.</p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Managing common vaccine-induced AEFIs </div>
                    <p>Parents should be given advice about AEFIs that they can expect and how such events should be managed. The leaflets on vaccinations provided by the Department of Health give information about AEFIs and include advice on their management. </p>
                    <p>Fevers over 37.5&degC are common in children and are usually mild. Advice on the use and appropriate dose of paracetamol or ibuprofen liquid to treat a fever should be given at the time of immunisation. Guidance on the treatment of feverish illness in children under five years of age from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence can be found at - <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.nice.org.uk/ nicemedia/live/11010/30523/30523.pdf', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">http://www.nice.org.uk/ nicemedia/live/11010/30523/30523.pdf</a>. Local reactions are usually self-limiting and do not require treatment. If they appear to cause discomfort, then paracetamol or ibuprofen can be given. </p>
                    <p>
                        Whilst paracetamol and ibuprofen can lower the duration of fever and reduce distress, there is no evidence that they prevent febrile convulsions. It is not therefore recommended that these drugs are used routinely to prevent fever following vaccination as there is some evidence that prophylactic administration of antipyretic drugs around the time of vaccination may lower antibody responses to some vaccines (Prymula <i>et al</i>., 2009).

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Thiomersal</div>
                    <p>Thiomersal is a mercury based compound has been used as a preservative in the manufacture of some vaccines for many years. In the UK, none of the routine childhood vaccines contain thiomersal. Two vaccines (Anthrax and the Green Cross Japanese Encephalitis vaccine) have thiomersal added to maintain sterility of batches, and a small number of other vaccines (Engerix B&reg , Twinrix&reg , Ambirix&reg , Fendrix&reg  and Fluvirin&reg) use thiomersal in the manufacturing process and may therefore contain trace levels of the compound. These vaccines are identified in relevant later chapters.</p>

                    <p>
                        Theoretical concerns have arisen around pediatric exposure to thiomersal through vaccine administration. This concern is based mainly on data following acute toxicity of a related substance, methylmercury, and from data on chronic exposure to mercury from the food chain. However, the low levels of thiomersal in vaccines have never been associated with these or similar conditions, including in children or pregnant women. Thiomersal has been linked to a very low risk of localised hypersensitivity reactions (Leventhal <i>et al</i>., 2012), which can present as redness, swelling or a rash at the injection site.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since 1999, supported by published epidemiological evidence, several regulatory authorities and scientific committees have reviewed the safety of thiomersal in vaccines. These include the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), the World Health Organization, the United States Institute of Medicine, and the European Medicines Agency. These reviews have consistently concluded that there is no evidence of an association between thiomersal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.</p>

                    <p>Some other AEFIs occur rarely and include those that are neurological or immune-mediated. Examples include seizures, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (HHE), idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP), acute arthropathy, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Anaphylaxis</div>
                    <p>
                        Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are extremely rare but have the potential to be fatal. Between 1997 and 2003, there were 130 reports to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of anaphylaxis or anaphylactic-type reactions following immunisation (excluding the meningitis C campaign), although no deaths as a result of the reaction were reported. In that time, around 117 million doses of all vaccines were supplied to hospitals and GPs. This rate (approximately one per million vaccine doses) is similar to that reported from other countries (Bohlke <i>et al</i>., 2003&#59; Canadian Medical Association, 2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>Onset of anaphylaxis is rapid, typically within minutes, and its clinical course is unpredictable with variable severity and clinical features. Due to the unpredictable nature of anaphylactic reactions it is not possible to define a particular time period over which all individuals should be observed following immunisation to ensure they do not develop anaphylaxis.</p>
                    <p>
                        Most anaphylactic reactions occur in individuals who have no known risk factors. A single set of criteria will not identify all anaphylactic reactions. There is a range of signs and symptoms, none of which are entirely specific for an anaphylactic reaction&#59; however, certain combinations of signs make the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction more likely (Brown, 2004). When recognising and treating any acutely ill patient, a rational Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure (ABCDE) approach must be followed and life-threatening problems treated as they are recognised (Resuscitation Council UK, 2008).
                    </p>
                    <p>Confusion arises because some patients have systemic allergic reactions that are less severe. For example, generalised urticaria, angioedema and rhinitis would not be described as an anaphylactic reaction because the life-threatening features - an airway problem, respiratory difficulty (breathing problem) and hypotension (circulation problem) - are not present. </p>
                    <p>Anaphylaxis is likely when all of the following three criteria are met: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>sudden onset and rapid progression of symptoms </span>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Differential diagnosis </div>
                    <p>All medical and nursing staff involved in immunisation should be able to distinguish an anaphylactic reaction from fainting (syncope) and panic attacks.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Fainting</b> is relatively common when vaccinating adults and adolescents, but infants and children rarely faint. Sudden loss of consciousness in young children should be presumed to be an anaphylactic reaction, particularly if a strong central pulse is absent. A strong central pulse persists during a faint or seizure.
                    </p>
                    <p>The features listed in Table 8.1 differentiate between anaphylaxis and fainting. If the diagnosis is unclear, anaphylaxis should be presumed and appropriate management given. <br>There should be rapid recovery from fainting. Although symptoms of malaise may persist, the patient should recover consciousness within a few minutes. </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Panic attacks</b> should also be distinguished from anaphylaxis. Some individuals may suffer panic attacks even before immunisation is undertaken. Symptoms include hyperventilation that may lead to paraesthesiae (numbness and tingling) in the arms and legs. There may be an erythematous rash associated with anxiety, although hypotension, pallor or wheezing will not be present.
                    </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Management of anaphylaxis </div>
                    <p>
                        <b>Guidelines on the management of anaphylaxis have been modified to ensure agreement between the Resuscitation Council UK, the British National Formulary, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (Resuscitation Council UK, 2008).</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>All health professionals responsible for immunisation must be familiar with techniques for resuscitation of a patient with anaphylaxis to prevent disability and loss of life. A protocol for the management of anaphylaxis and an anaphylaxis pack must always be available whenever vaccines are given. </p>

                        The use of <b>intravenous</b> (IV) adrenaline (epinephrine) is hazardous and should only be considered in extreme emergency in patients with profound shock that is immediately life-threatening. Only dilute adrenaline (at least 1:10,000) should be used, and the injection given slowly. Intravenous adrenaline should only be used by those experienced in its use and ideally with the patient being monitored (at least pulse oximetry, blood pressure, ECG).

                    <p>Because of the possibility of delayed reactions, individuals who have had an anaphylactic reaction should be sent to hospital, even though they may appear to have made a full recovery.</p>
                    <p>Give high flow oxygen therapy as soon as oxygen is available. Rescuers should manage the airway according to their level of training and equipment available. </p>

                <p>Hydrocortisone should only be given after a severe anaphylactic attack to prevent any late symptoms. </p>
                <p>Continuing deterioration requires further treatment, including fluid infusion. As soon as IV access is available a crystalloid solution (e.g. 0.9% sodium chloride or Hartmann's) may be safer than a colloid solution, and should be given in a rapid infusion of 1-2l, or for children 20ml/kg of body weight, with another similar dose if there is no clinical response.</p>
