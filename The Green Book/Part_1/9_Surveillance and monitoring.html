                    <p>This chapter describes the process of vaccine safety monitoring in the UK and the reporting of adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) (see Chapter 8). It also describes the mechanism for the reporting of suspected defects in vaccines or in the devices used for the administration of vaccines.</p>
                    <p>All vaccines are extensively tested for quality, safety and immunogenicity and/or efficacy before being licensed and used routinely. As not all side effects may have been identified prior to licensing, particularly if they occur very rarely, careful surveillance is required throughout their use. Important information on vaccine safety is routinely collected through the Yellow Card scheme and from other sources, including medical literature, post-marketing safety studies, epidemiological databases and other worldwide organisations.</p>
                    <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has responsibility for monitoring the safety of all marketed medicines (including vaccines) and medical devices. Suspected adverse events following the use of vaccines, medicines and medical devices should be reported to the MHRA.</p>

                        <p>The Yellow Card scheme is a voluntary reporting system for suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) to medicines, which includes vaccines. AEFIs that are suspected to be vaccine-induced should be reported as ADRs via the Yellow Card scheme. An ADR is an unwanted or harmful reaction following the administration of a medicine, vaccine or combination of vaccines. The ADR may be a known AEFI (see Chapter 8), or it may be previously unrecognised. Spontaneous reports of suspected ADRs are received from UK doctors, pharmacists, dentists, coroners, nurses, midwives, health visitors and patients. There is also a statutory requirement for pharmaceutical companies to report to the MHRA serious suspected ADRs associated with their products.</p>
                        <p>Reports of suspected ADRs submitted through the Yellow Card scheme are entered onto a computer database operated by the MHRA. The reporter receives an acknowledgement and is supplied with a unique registration number. Reports of suspected ADRs are regularly reviewed, and appropriate investigation and action is initiated if a possible problem is identified. Information relating to the MHRA and the Yellow Card scheme can be found on the MHRA website (<a href="www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>) and at <a href="www.yellowcard.gov.uk">www.yellowcard.gov.uk</a>. Information on individual patients and reporters submitted to the MHRA is confidential.</p>
                        <p>The five regional monitoring centres of the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) work in conjunction with the MHRA in collecting data on ADRs and facilitating local ADR reporting (see end of chapter).</p>

                    <p>The success of the Yellow Card scheme depends on early, complete and accurate reporting of suspected ADRs. A Yellow Card should be submitted when a causal association is suspected between the product administered and the condition experienced by the patient. The MHRA encourages reporting of suspected ADRs even if there is uncertainty as to whether the vaccine played a causal role.</p>
                    <p>All suspected ADRs occurring in children should be reported.</p>
                    <p>
                        Newly licensed vaccine products are subject to enhanced surveillance and are given&#145;black triangle&#146; status (indicated by an inverted triangle &#9660 on the product information). For such products, all serious and non-serious suspected ADRs should be reported, for both adults and children.
                    </p>
                    <p>For vaccines that have been marketed for two years or more, only serious suspected ADRs should be reported. This applies to all serious reactions, whether or not such reactions have previously been recognised with the suspected vaccine. Serious reactions that should be reported include those that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>However, a reporter can also state that a case is serious for any reason other than those outlined here.</p>
                    <p>When submitting a Yellow Card, the vaccine brand name and batch number should be provided. If the brand name is unavailable, the active ingredient or antigen type should be clearly identified, e.g. pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should be clearly distinguished from plain pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.</p>
                    <p>It is important to give as much information as possible about the nature, timing and severity of the suspected ADR, if the patient was hospitalised, what treatment was given and the outcome. Information about other factors, such as immunisation history, concomitant vaccines, underlying disease, allergies or family history, should be provided whenever possible. The provision of additional information, such as test results or relevant hospital correspondence, is always helpful.</p>
                    <p>Any further information, including where subsequent investigations implicate another possible cause for the condition, should be sent to the MHRA to help in the assessment of the suspected ADR. The Yellow Card registration number, provided to reporters on acknowledgement of receipt of the Yellow Card, should be quoted. The MHRA may also contact the reporter directly if specific information on a suspected ADR is required.</p>

                    <p>It is a matter of clinical judgement whether a suspected ADR should be reported or not. Although a reaction might occur in close temporal association with an immunisation, often it can be very difficult to assess whether there is a causal link. If there is any suspicion that the reaction is vaccine-induced, an ADR should be reported. Many suspected ADRs are actually medical conditions that have occurred spontaneously and coincidentally.</p>
                    <p>The probability that a vaccine has caused an ADR may be increased if there is biological plausibility for the event. For instance, pyrexial illness occurring five to ten days or parotid swelling occurring three weeks after measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisation would be consistent with the incubation periods for measles or mumps viruses. On the other hand, pyrexia occurring less than three days after MMR vaccination is unlikely to be caused by the immunisation, and an underlying infection is a more likely explanation.</p>

                    <p>Yellow Cards are important in generating possible new signals of safety concerns. When assessing whether a signal generated by Yellow Cards or from other sources is vaccine-induced, all of the available evidence is considered.</p>
                    <p>Causality assessment often depends on factors that include biological plausibility -an excess of events in a specified post-immunisation period compared with background rates and laboratory evidence.</p>
                    <p>
                        Formal epidemiological studies are required to strengthen or refute an assessment of causality. Where a causal association is demonstrated, the level of risk should be quantified and the risk factors established. For example, by linking computer records of hospital admissions and MMR immunisation, a positive association was found between MMR and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). One case of ITP, attributable to vaccine, occurs for every 32,000 doses administered (Miller <i>et al</i>., 2001). Using a similar method, the hypothesis that oral live polio vaccine was associated with intussusception was rejected (Andrews <i>et al</i>., 2001).
                    </p>
                    <p>Matters relating to vaccine safety are kept under constant review. The CHM and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) are independent, expert scientific committees that advise the Government. The CHM advises on the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines and vaccines, and the JCVI provides expert advice on immunisation policy. These committees examine carefully any new evidence that relates to vaccine safety, and make recommendations on the subsequent use of a vaccine or the implementation of the immunisation programme.</p>

                    <p>Regulatory action may be taken by the MHRA on the recommendation of the CHM. This could involve withdrawal of a vaccine but would more often involve an amendment to a vaccine licence (marketing authorisation) in order to ensure that it is used more safely and effectively.

                        Medical devices and equipment are items used for the diagnosis and/or treatment of disease, or for monitoring patients, as well as aids for daily living. This covers a wide range of products used every day in primary and acute care settings, in residential or nursing settings or in the patient&#146;s own home, and by school nurses. Examples of devices relevant to the immunisation programme include needles and syringes, vials or ampoules.

                        Additional information and examples of categories of medical devices can be found on the&#145;Devices information&#146; part of the MHRA website (<a href="www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>). The MHRA assesses all reports of adverse incidents involving medical devices and, where appropriate, instigates an investigation, corrective actions and design changes to reduce the risk of recurrence.

                    <p>Defects in medical devices may occur because of:</p>

                    <p>A defective medical device may cause unexpected or unwanted effects involving the safety of patients, device users or other persons. Any adverse incident involving a medical device should be reported, especially if the incident has led to or could lead to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    <p>Defective devices and adverse incidents should be reported at the earliest opportunity, following any local incident-reporting policies. Adverse events involving immunisation equipment (rather than the vaccine itself) should be reported to the medical devices Adverse Incident Centre (AIC) at the MHRA. If in doubt, contact the MHRA about the most appropriate reporting route.</p>
                    <p>
                        Where possible, reports should be submitted electronically using the medical device online reporting system on the MHRA&#146;s website (<a href="www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>). This provides an immediate acknowledgement and MHRA reference number for each report, and also allows you to e-mail a copy to others within your organisation. However, if necessary, forms may be downloaded from the website or obtained from the AIC and can be e-mailed or faxed to AIC (see contact details at the end of the chapter). Detailed information on reporting adverse incidents with medical devices can be found on the MHRA website, from the AIC or from your local Medical Device Liaison Officer.
