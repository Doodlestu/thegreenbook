                  <p>The Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS) provides a single, tax-free
					payment. The VDPS payment is provided to people or their families who have
					suffered severe mental and/or physical disablement as a result of immunisation
					against one or more of the following diseases:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><span>diphtheria</span></li>
                      <li><span>Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)</span></li>
                      <li><span>measles</span></li>
                      <li><span>meningococcal group C</span></li>
                      <li><span>mumps</span></li>
                      <li><span>pertussis (whooping cough)</span></li>
                      <li><span>pneumococcal infection</span></li>
                      <li><span>poliomyelitis</span></li>
                      <li><span>rubella (German measles)</span></li>
                      <li><span>tetanus</span></li>
                      <li><span>tuberculosis (TB)</span></li>
                      <li><span>smallpox (up to 1 August 1971)</span></li>
                      <li><span>human papillomavirus (HPV)</span></li>
                      <li><span>pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 (swine flu) (up to 31 August 2010).</span></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The scheme also covers individuals found to be severely disabled either
					because their mother was immunised against any of the specified diseases
					while she was pregnant, or because they have been in close physical contact
					with a person who has received an oral vaccine against poliomyelitis.</p>
                  <p>The payment is not compensation but is designed to ease the present and future
					burdens of the vaccine-damaged person and their family. The amount payable
					is &pound;120,000 for claims made on or after 12 July 2007.</p>
              	<p>A decision to offer vaccine should be based upon the recommendations in the
					Green Book and not be influenced by vaccine's eligibility for a VDPS settlement.</p>

                <p>Decisions on claims are based on an evaluation of the medical evidence by a
				Medical Adviser acting on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions.
                The Medical Adviser considers whether, on balance of probability, the
                disability is the result of the immunisation. If the Medical Adviser considers
                that it is, they will advise the percentage level of disablement attributed to the
                immunisation.</p>
                <p>If a claim is disallowed, the claimant may ask the Department for Work and
                Pensions to look again at the decision. The claimant can do this by writing to
                the Vaccine Damage Payments Unit, providing an explanation of why they
                believe the decision to be wrong. There is no time limit for seeking a reversal
                of the decision if the original decision was made after 28 October 2013,
                otherwise there is a six-year time limit. If they still disagree with the decision
                after this, they can make an appeal to an independent First-Tier tribunal.</p>

                <p>The disabled person must be over two years of age and must have been

                   or their families if one or any of the immunisations listed above were given as
                   part of the Armed Forces' medical services outside of the UK.</p>

                papillomavirus or pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 for which there is no
                upper age limit. In addition, individuals of any age are eligible if immunised
                against any of the other listed diseases during an outbreak within the UK or the

                <p>Payments are made direct to disabled persons aged 18 or over who are capable
                of managing their own affairs. In other cases, payment will be made to trustees.
                If the disabled person lives with their family, the parents may be appointed as
                trustees. If the disabled person has died, payment will be made to their personal
                representative.</p>

                Disablement Scheme. Under this scheme, 60% disablement equates to, for
                example, lower leg amputation, loss of one hand or deafness where the individual
                cannot hear a conversational voice beyond a distance of one metre. A vaccinerelevant
                example would be paralysis of a limb after oral poliomyelitis vaccine.</p>
                
                <p>Medical Advisers who advise on claims under the VDPS are registered
