                    <p>Vaccines may lose their effectiveness if they become too hot or too cold at any time. Vaccines naturally biodegrade over time, and storage outside of the recommended temperature range - including during transport - may speed up loss of potency, which cannot be reversed. This may result in the failure of the vaccine to create the desired immune response and consequently provide poor protection. Inappropriate storage and transport also results in wastage and unnecessary costs to the NHS.</p>
                    <p>Anyone handling vaccines should follow appropriate policies to ensure cold chain compliance. The guidance in this chapter should be used to define local policies, including patient group directions (PGDs) (see Chapter 5), and should be read in conjunction with the individual summaries of product characteristics (SPCs) that are supplied by the manufacturers of the vaccines.</p>
                    <p>
                        Storage requirements are described in SPCs. Vaccines that have not been transported or stored accordingly are no longer within the terms of the marketing authorisation (product licence) and should not be used without a risk assessment based on a thorough understanding of the likely impact of the temperature variation on the vaccine. Any use of vaccines that have deviated from recommended storage or transportation conditions is the responsibility of the user. For specific guidance around considerations of when vaccines may still be used, see &#145;Refrigerator failure or disruption of the cold chain&#146; - page 30). Guidance on how to manage a situation where vaccines that have not been stored correctly have already been administered has been produced by the HPA (<a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1267551139589', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1267551139589</a>.)

                    <p>In organisations such as GP surgeries or community health service providers, at least two individuals need to be nominated, one from the nursing team and one from the administration/management team. These people will be responsible for ordering, receipt and care of vaccines. They should ensure vaccines are stored in a refrigerator promptly after delivery and that there is maintenance of the cold chain at all stages. They should understand the need for stock control and careful stock rotation (using those vaccines with the shortest expiry dates first). They will be responsible for ensuring there is regular recording throughout the cold chain and that damaged or out of date vaccines and vaccine related healthcare waste are disposed of appropriately.</p>
                    <p>Staff who order vaccines should ensure they meet all necessary legal requirements for the subsequent possession of vaccines, which are prescription-only medicines (POMs). This will be covered when they are acting on behalf of a registered medical practitioner with a licence to practice or because the use of the vaccine is authorised through a patient group direction (see Chapter 5).</p>

                    <p>The Department of Health (England) buys vaccines on behalf of the NHS for use in routine national immunisation programmes. This central purchasing allows the UK to negotiate better prices with manufacturers, enabling the introduction and maintenance of vaccine programmes that may otherwise be unaffordable or available to fewer patient groups. Specialist immunoglobulins and antitoxins are also purchased for post-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of rare infections. Other vaccines are ordered directly from the manufacturer or through pharmacies and wholesalers. Details of manufacturers are shown throughout this book, at the end of each chapter.</p>
                    <p>Centrally purchased vaccines should only be used for purposes approved by the Department of Health and the devolved administrations. Healthcare professionals should ensure they are using appropriately sourced vaccines for the particular clinical circumstances. Using centrally purchased vaccines for incorrect purposes could prevent NHS patients who require immunisation from being able to access it. If centrally purchased vaccines are knowingly used for non-approved circumstances, particularly private health services, this may also be considered fraudulent.</p>

These patients should be offered catch-up vaccinations. Opportunistic catch-up also includes ensuring tetanus protection is up to date following wounds (see Chapter 30). GPs should use centrally purchased stock in conjunction with clinical records. For hospitals offering vaccination against tetanus for patients with uncertain immunisation histories, stocks of tetanus-containing vaccine should be obtained through other sources, such as the DH Commercial Medicines Unit hospital framework agreement in England.</span>

                        Vaccine effectiveness can not be guaranteed unless the vaccine has been stored correctly. Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging, retaining batch numbers and expiry dates. Vaccines should be stored according to the manufacturer&#146;s summary of product characteristics (SPC) - usually at +2&deg;C to +8&deg;C and protected from light. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light will cause loss of potency. Within the refrigerator, sufficient space around the vaccine packages should be left for air to circulate. Vaccines should be kept away from the side and back walls of the refrigerator; otherwise the vaccines may freeze rendering them inactive and unusable.
                    </p>
                    <p>Examples of good practice include:</p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Storage of reconstituted vaccines</div>
                    <p>For some vaccines, there is a need to reconstitute the vaccine using a diluent. Storage requirements for the reconstituted vaccines vary and the SPC or packaging insert should be consulted to identify the specific requirements for these vaccines. Generally, it is not good practice to reconstitute vaccines in advance, although in some cases, such as using multi-dose vials, it can be considered. If a vaccine is reconstituted but not used immediately, it is good practice to label the vaccine with date and time of reconstitution and the initials of the person reconstituting the vaccine. These reconstituted vaccines should be stored in line with the guidance given in the SPC or packaging insert and any local policies.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Storage of immunoglobulins</div>
                    <p>
                        Immunoglobulins should be stored in the original packaging, retaining batch numbers and expiry dates. Immunoglobulins should be stored at &#43; 2&deg C to &#43; 8&deg C and protected from light. Although these products have a tolerance to ambient temperatures (up to 25&deg C) for up to one week, they should be refrigerated immediately on receipt. They can be distributed in sturdy packaging outside the cold chain to an end-user (such as the GP or hospital caring for a patient). They should not be frozen. See Chapters 17 (Hepatitis A), 18 (Hepatitis B), 21 (Measles), 27 Rabies and 34 (Varicella) for specific information about administering immunoglobulins.

                    <p>Patients or parents/carers should not normally be asked to store vaccines or immunoglobulins. Exceptionally, patients or parents/carers may be asked to transport and/or to store them for short periods of time. Should this need arise, advice on appropriate storage must be given to the patient or parents/carers.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">The vaccine refrigerator</div>
                    <p>Specialised refrigerators are available for the storage of pharmaceutical products and must be used for vaccines and diluents. Ordinary domestic refrigerators must not be used. Food, drink and clinical specimens must never be stored in the same refrigerator as vaccines. Opening of the refrigerator door should be kept to a minimum in order to maintain a constant temperature. The fridge temperature gauge should be clearly visible to read without needing to open the fridge door.</p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Refrigerator thermometers</div>
                    <p>The temperature within the vaccine refrigerator must be monitored continually with a maximum-minimum thermometer. This will identify when the temperature may have been outside the recommended range. Digital thermometers are the most reliable. More sophisticated temperature-recording devices are now available, including alarmed digital maximum-minimum thermometers and data loggers.</p>
                    <p>At least one maximum-minimum thermometer that is independent of mains power should be used (as well as any integrated thermometer), so temperatures can be measured in the event of electricity loss. The maximum-minimum thermometer should be calibrated annually to confirm that it is giving accurate readings.</p>
                    <p>If checks suggest the thermometer is faulty, the following actions should be taken:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>Temperatures in the refrigerator must be monitored and recorded at least once each working day, and documented on a chart for recording temperatures. An example can be found on page 36. The records should be readily accessible, be retained for at least one year, and cover the full storage history of any products contained in the fridge (NHS East of England Senior Pharmacy Managers Network 2008; Department of Health 2009). As shelf lives specified by vaccine manufacturers can be up to four years or longer, retaining records for five years will generally enable the full storage history of the vaccines be accounted for.</p>
                    <p>Temperatures of cool boxes should be monitored when in use, using maximum- minimum thermometers. Temperatures should be recorded at the start and end of each session (further information on cool boxes is given below).</p>

                        Vaccine stability data outside of the registered range (for example +2&deg;C to +8&deg;C) may not have been reviewed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) who give the marketing authorisation for the vaccine. Product quality, safety or efficacy may have been adversely affected as a result of the temperature excursion.

                    <p>Any use of vaccines that have deviated from recommended storage or transportation conditions is the responsibility of the user. The risk assessment and decision to use the vaccine after it has been stored at an incorrect temperature must be made on a case-by-case basis. Consideration must be given to the level of evidence available regarding the stability of the vaccine outside the correct temperature range over the relevant duration of time. Users must ensure that they have sufficient information to make an informed assessment and decision. Pharmacists in the local provider or commissioning organisation (e.g. medicines management team) may be able to advise on temperature stability.</p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Validated cool boxes (carriers) and transporting vaccines</div>
                    <p>
                        Domestic cool boxes should not be used to store, distribute or transport vaccines. Validated cool boxes and cool packs from a recognised medical supply company should be used in conjunction with validated maximum- minimum thermometers. Cool packs should be stored in accordance with the manufacturers instructions, usually at +2&deg;C to +8&deg;C (not a freezer compartment) to ensure they maintain the cold chain at the right temperature. In general, ice packs and frozen cool packs should not be used as there is a danger of these freezing some vaccine doses during transit. The exception to this is when the cool box manufacturer&#146;s instructions specifically state that ice packs should be used. Individual manufacturer&#146;s instructions should be strictly adhered to.
                    </p>
                    <p>A validated cool box provides ongoing assurance that the vaccines will be maintained within the cold chain temperature range during transport. With time and use, cool boxes may no longer be able to maintain this temperature range for extended periods so monitoring is always required. The cool box manufacturer should also provide sufficient evidence for assurance that a stable temperature within the range of the cold chain can be maintained for several hours.</p>
                    <p>
                        Vaccines must be kept in the original packaging, wrapped in bubble wrap (or similar insulation material) and placed into a cool box with cool packs as per the manufacturer&#146;s instructions. This will prevent direct contact between the vaccine and the cool packs and will protect the vaccine from any damage.
                    </p>
                    <p>When transporting vaccines, the named individuals are responsible for ensuring that only the amounts of vaccines necessary for each session are removed from the vaccine refrigerator. These should be placed quickly into the validated cool boxes and opening must be kept to a minimum. If there are any unused vaccines left over at the end of a vaccination session, providing there is evidence from the temperature monitoring that the cold chain has been maintained, the vaccines can be returned to the vaccine refrigerator. Returned vaccines should be used at the earliest opportunity. If the cold chain cannot be guaranteed, a risk assessment should be done, as described in the previous section.</p>
