                    <p>Primary immunisation with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib (DTaP/IPV/Hib) vaccine is given at two, three and four months of age. Pneumococcal vaccine is given at two and four months. MenC vaccine is given at three and four months. This ensures completion of the primary course at an appropriate age to provide protection against infections such as whooping cough, pneumococcal, Hib and meningococcal serogroup C, which are most dangerous for the very young.</p>
                    <p>Every effort should be made to ensure that all children are immunised, even if they are older than the recommended age range; no opportunity to immunise should be missed.</p>

If children coming to the UK are not known to have been completely immunised, they should be assumed to be unimmunised and a full course of immunisations should be planned. </p>
                    <p>Where a child born in the UK presents with an inadequate immunisation history, every effort should be made to clarify what immunisations they may have had. A child who has not completed the routine childhood programme should have the outstanding doses as described in the relevant chapters. </p>
                    <p>Children coming to the UK who have a history of completing immunisation in their country of origin may not have been offered protection against all the antigens currently protected against in the UK. For country-specific information, please refer to <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/en/', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/en/globalsummary/countryprofileselect.cfm.</a></p>
                    <p>Children coming from developing countries, from areas of conflict or from hard-to-reach population groups may not have been fully immunised. Where there is no reliable history of previous immunisation, it should be assumed that children are unimmunised and the full UK recommendations should be followed.</p>
                    <p>Children coming to the UK may have had a fourth dose of a diphtheria/ tetanus/pertussis-containing vaccine that is given at around 18 months in some countries. This dose should be discounted, as it may not provide satisfactory protection until the time of the teenage booster. The routine pre-school and subsequent boosters should be given according to the UK schedule. </p>

                    <p>It is important that premature infants have their immunisations at the appropriate chronological age, according to the schedule. The occurrence of apnoea following vaccination is especially increased in infants who were born very prematurely.</p>
                    <p>
                        Very premature infants (born &#8804 28 weeks of gestation) who are in hospital should have respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs when given their first immunisation, particularly those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. If the child has apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations after the first immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital, with respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs (Pfister <i>et al</i>., 2004; Ohlsson <i>et al</i>., 2004; Schulzke <i>et al</i>., 2005; Pourcyrous <i>et al</i>., 2007; Klein <i>et al</i>., 2008).
                    </p>
                    <p>As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should
					   not be withheld or delayed.</p>

                    <p>Five doses of diphtheria, tetanus and polio vaccines ensure long-term protection through adulthood. Individuals who have not completed the five doses should have their remaining doses at the appropriate interval. Where there is an unclear history of vaccination, adults should be assumed to be unimmunised. A full course of diphtheria, tetanus and polio should be offered in line with advice contained in the relevant chapters.</p>
                    <p>Older adults (65 years or older) should be routinely offered a single dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, if they have not previously received it. Annual influenza vaccination should also be offered.</p>
                    <p>Selective vaccines should also be considered for young adults unprotected against diseases including measles, mumps, rubella and meningococcal C. Other vaccinations should be considered for any adult with underlying medical conditions and those at higher risk because of their lifestyle. These vaccinations include Hib, MenC, influenza, pneumococcal and hepatitis B. For more information please see the relevant chapters.</p>
