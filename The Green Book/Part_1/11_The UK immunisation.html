                  <div id="thirdtitle">The immunisation schedule</div>
                  <p>The schedule for routine immunisations and instructions for how they should be administered  are given in Table 11.1.</p>
                  <p>Primary immunisation with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib (DTaP/IPV/Hib) vaccine is given at two, three and four months of age. Pneumococcal vaccine is given at two and four months. MenC vaccine is given at three and four months. This ensures completion of the primary course at an appropriate age to provide protection against infections such as whooping cough, pneumococcal, Hib and meningococcal serogroup C, which are most dangerous for the very young.</p>
                  <p>Every effort should be made to ensure that all children are immunised, even if they are older than the recommended age range; no opportunity to immunise should be missed.</p>
                  <p><b>If any course of immunisation is interrupted, it should be resumed and completed as soon as possible. There is no need to start any course of immunisation again.</b></p>
                  <p><b>Children should have received these vaccines by these ages:</b></p>
                  <p>When babies are immunised in special care units, or children are immunised opportunistically in accident and emergency units or inpatient facilities, it is most important that a record of the immunisation is sent to the primary care trust, NHS trust or health board by return of an ‘unscheduled immunisation form’.</p>

                <p>For a variety of reasons, some children may not have been immunised or their immunisation history may be unknown. If children coming to the UK are not known to have been completely immunised, they should be assumed to be unimmunised and a full course of immunisations should be planned. </p>
                <p>Where a child born in the UK presents with an inadequate immunisation history, every effort should be made to clarify what immunisations they may have had. A child who has not completed the routine childhood programme should have the outstanding doses as described in the relevant chapters. </p>
                <p>Children coming to the UK who have a history of completing immunisation in their country of origin may not have been offered protection against all the antigens currently protected against in the UK. For country-specific information, please refer to www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/en/globalsummary/ countryprofileselect.cfm.The </p>
                <p>Children coming from developing countries, from areas of conflict or from hard-to-reach population groups may not have been fully immunised. Where there is no reliable history of previous immunisation, it should be assumed that children are unimmunised and the full UK recommendations should be followed.</p>
                <p>Children coming to the UK may have had a fourth dose of a diphtheria/ tetanus/pertussis-containing vaccine that is given at around 18 months in some countries. This dose should be discounted, as it may not provide satisfactory protection until the time of the teenage booster. The routine pre-school and subsequent boosters should be given according to the UK schedule. </p>
