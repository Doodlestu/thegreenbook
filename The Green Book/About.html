                <div id="thirdtitle">About The Green Book App</div>
                <p>In 2006, the UK Department of Health last published ‘Immunisation against infectious disease’. This is now more commonly referred to as the ‘Green Book’. This book was developed to contain the latest information on vaccines and vaccination procedures, for vaccine preventable infectious diseases in the UK.</p>
               <p>The Green Book is now no longer produced in hard copy as it is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in policies and procedures as advised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).</p>
               <p>The Green Book App has been created to reflect the changing ways in which professionals choose to access information. With the rapid and wide adoption of smartphones, and the increasing localised working trend of healthcare professionals, The Green Book App provides users with the ability to access the latest guidance and information wherever they are, whenever they need it.</p>
               <p>The App will be updated regularly as new updates are released from Public Health England, and as such it has just been updated to include all the latest flu guidance for the forthcoming 2014/15 flu season. This makes The Green Book App a must have for all healthcare professionals.</p>
                
                 <div id="thirdtitle">Acknowledgements</div>
                
                <p>We would like to acknowledge Public Health England and the work of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) for their continued work in reviewing and updating the content of ‘Immunisation against infectious disease’ upon which this app is based. With particular thanks to Professor David Salisbury CB FRCP FRCPCH FFPH for his inspiration. </p>
                <p>Special acknowledgment goes to Stuart Buckley, Heather Lambert, Steve Lambert and Oliver Jackson whose hard work and dedication to improving immunisation rates and reducing cases of vaccine-preventable disease has led them to develop this application. It is hoped that by increased access and availability to the latest guidance this will lead to enhanced population healthcare.</p>
                <p>First published in 2006 as Immunisation against infectious disease by The Stationery Office, and popularly known as the ‘Green Book’, this publication is now available as individual chapters via the Immunisation section of the GOV.UK website and not in printed form. These chapters are updated as necessary to reflect the current policies and procedures as advised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.</p>
