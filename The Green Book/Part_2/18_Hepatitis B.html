                        <p>
                            Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Many new infections with hepatitis B are sub-clinical or may have a
                            flu-like illness. Jaundice only occurs in about 10% of younger children and in 30 to 50% of adults. Acute infection may occasionally lead to fulminant
                            hepatic necrosis, which is often fatal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The illness usually starts insidiously - with anorexia and nausea and an ache in the right upper abdomen. Fever, when present, is usually mild. Malaise may
                            be profound, with disinclination to smoke or to drink alcohol. As jaundice develops, there is progressive darkening of the urine and lightening of the
                            faeces. In patients who do not develop symptoms suggestive of hepatitis, the illness will only be detected by abnormal liver function tests and/or the
                            presence of serological markers of hepatitis B infection (e.g. hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antiHBc IgM).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The virus is transmitted by parenteral exposure to infected blood or body fluids. Transmission mostly occurs:

                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span>through vaginal or anal intercourse </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>as a result of blood-to-blood contact (e.g. sharing of needles and other equipment by injecting drug users (IDUs), ‘needlestick&#146; injuries) </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>through perinatal transmission from mother to child. </span>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Transmission has also followed bites from infected persons, although this is rare. Transfusion-associated infection is now rare in the UK as blood
                        donations are screened. Viral inactivation of blood products has eliminated these as a source of infection in this country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The incubation period ranges from 40 to 160 days, with an average of 60 to 90 days. Current infection can be detected by the presence of HBsAg in the
                        serum. Blood and body fluids from these individuals should be considered to be infectious. In most individuals, infection will resolve and HBsAg disappears
                        from the serum, but the virus persists in some patients who become chronically infected with hepatitis B.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chronic hepatitis B infection is defined as persistence of HBsAg in the serum for six months or longer. Individuals with chronic infection are sometimes
                        referred to as chronic carriers. Among those who are HBsAg positive, those in whom hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) is also detected in the serum are the most
                        infectious. Those who are HBsAg positive and HBeAg negative (usually anti-HBe positive) are infectious but generally of lower infectivity. Recent evidence
                        suggests that a proportion of chronically infected people who are HBeAg negative will have high HBV DNA levels, and may be more infectious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The risk of developing chronic hepatitis B infection depends on the age at which infection is acquired. Chronic infection occurs in 90% of those infected
                        perinatally but is less frequent in those infected as children (e.g. 20 to 50% in children between one and five years of age). About 5% or less of
                        previously healthy people, infected as adults, become chronically infected (Hyams, 1995). The risk is increased in those whose immunity is impaired.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around 20 to 25% of individuals with chronic HBV infection worldwide have progressive liver disease, leading to cirrhosis in some patients. The risk of
                        progression is related to the level of active viral replication in the liver. Individuals with chronic hepatitis B infection - particularly those with an
                        active inflammation and/or cirrhosis, where there is rapid cell turnover - are at increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
                    </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>

                    <p>
                        The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that over 350 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HBV. The WHO has categorised
                        countries based upon the prevalence of HBsAg into high (more than 8%), intermediate (2 to 8%) and low (less than 2%) endemicity countries. In many
                        high-prevalence countries, 10% or more of the population have chronic hepatitis B infection. High-prevalence regions include sub-Saharan Africa, most of
                        Asia and the Pacific islands. Intermediate-prevalence regions include the Amazon, southern parts of Eastern and Central Europe, the Middle East and the
                        Indian sub-continent. Low-prevalence regions include most of Western Europe and North America (see Figure 18.1).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The importance of the various modes of transmission varies according to the prevalence in a particular country. In areas of high prevalence, infection is
                        acquired predominantly in childhood - by perinatal transmission or by horizontal transmission among young children. In low-endemicity countries, most
                        infections are acquired in adulthood, where sexual transmission or sharing of blood-contaminated needles and equipment by injecting drug users accounts for
                        a significant proportion of new infections. In areas of intermediate endemicity, the pattern of perinatal, childhood and adult infection is mixed, and
                        nosocomial infection may be important.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The UK is a very low-prevalence country, but prevalence of HBsAg varies across the country. It is higher in those born in high-endemicity countries, many
                        of whom will have acquired infection at birth or in early childhood (Boxall <em>et al</em>.,1994; Aweis <em>et al.</em>, 2001). This is reflected in the
                        prevalence rates found in antenatal women, which vary from 0.05 to 0.08% in some rural areas but rise to 1% or more in certain inner city areas. Overall,
                        the prevalence in antenatal women in the UK is around 0.14%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The incidence of acute infection is high among those with certain lifestyle or occupational risk factors. Most reports of acute infection in the UK occur
                        as a result of injecting drug use or sexual exposure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Laboratory reports of acute hepatitis B to the Health Protection Agency fell from a peak of just below 2000 reports from England and Wales in 1984 to 531
                        reports in 1992, mainly due to a decline in cases in IDUs. The decrease was also seen in other risk groups, most probably linked to a modification of risk
                        behaviours in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Since then there has been no further fall; reports have fluctuated between around 600 and 800 cases per
                        year. In recent years, there has been a fall in the number of reports in men who have sex with men (MSM), but a rise among IDUs. In Scotland in 2003, 87
                        acute infections were reported; the commonest risk factor was injecting drugs.

                    <p>There are two classes of products available for immunisation against hepatitis B: a vaccine that confers active immunity and a specific immunoglobulin that provides passive and temporary immunity while awaiting response to vaccine.</p>

                    <p>
                        recombinant DNA technology. Fendrix&reg; , for patients with renal insufficiency, is adjuvanted by monophosophoryl lipid A, and adsorbed onto aluminium

                    <p>
                        A combined vaccine containing purified inactivated hepatitis A virus (HAV) and purified recombinant HBsAg, separately adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide and
                        aluminium phosphate, is also available where protection against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B infections is required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thiomersal is not used as a preservative in hepatitis B vaccines available in the UK. However, thiomersal is still used in the production process for
                        Engerix B&reg; , Twinrix&reg; , Ambirix&reg; and Fendrix&reg; and therefore, residues are present in the final product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hepatitis B-containing vaccines are inactivated, do not contain live organisms and cannot cause the diseases against which they protect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are vaccines that are effective in preventing infection in individuals who produce specific antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs). However, it is important
                        that immunisation against hepatitis B does not encourage relaxation of other measures designed to prevent exposure to the virus, for example condom use and
                        needle exchange. Healthcare workers giving immunisation should use the opportunity to provide advice on other preventative measures or to arrange referral
                        to appropriate specialist services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around 10 to 15% of adults fail to respond to three doses of vaccine or respond poorly. Poor responses are mostly associated with age over 40 years,
                        obesity and smoking (Roome <em>et al.</em>, 1993). Lower seroconversion rates have also been reported in alcoholics, particularly those with advanced liver
                        disease (Rosman <em>et al.</em>, 1997). Patients who are immunosuppressed or on renal dialysis may respond less well than healthy individuals and may
                        require larger or more frequent doses of vaccine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hepatitis B vaccine is highly effective at preventing infection if given shortly after exposure (see below). Ideally, immunisation should commence within
                        48 hours, although it should still be considered up to a week after exposure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The vaccine is not effective in patients with acute hepatitis B, and is not necessary for individuals known to have markers of current (HBsAg) or past
                        (anti-HB) infection. However, immunisation should not be delayed while awaiting any test results.
                    </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Hepatitis B immunoglobulin</div>

                    <p>
                        Specific hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) provides passive immunity and can give immediate but temporary protection after accidental inoculation or
                        contamination with hepatitis B-infected blood. HBIG is given concurrently with hepatitis B vaccine and does not affect the development of active immunity.
                        If infection has already occurred at the time of immunisation, virus multiplication may not be inhibited completely, but severe illness and, most
                        importantly, development of the carrier state may be prevented.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HBIG is used after exposure to give rapid protection until hepatitis B vaccine, which should be given at the same time, becomes effective. The use of HBIG
                        in addition to vaccine is recommended only in high-risk situations or in a known non-responder to vaccine. Whenever immediate protection is required,
                        immunisation with the vaccine should be given. When appropriate, this should be combined with simultaneous administration of HBIG at a different site. HBIG
                        should be given as soon as possible, ideally within 48 hours, although it should still be considered up to a week after exposure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HBIG is obtained from the plasma of immunised and screened human donors. Because of a theoretical risk of transmission of vCJD from plasma products, HBIG
                        used in the UK is now prepared from plasma sourced from outside the UK, and supplies are scarce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All donors are screened for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and all plasma pools are tested for the presence of RNA from these viruses. A solvent-
                        detergent inactivation step for envelope viruses is included in the production process. There is no evidence associating the administration of HBIG with
                        acquisition of HIV infection. Not only does the processing of the plasma from which it is prepared render it safe, but the screening of blood donations is
                        routine practice.
                    </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>

                    <p>
                        Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2˚C to +8˚C and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat and cold.
                        Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless they have
                        been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause hairline
                        cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HBIG should be stored in a refrigerator at +2˚C to +8˚C. These products are tolerant to ambient temperatures for up to one week. They can be distributed in
                        sturdy packaging outside the cold chain if needed.

                        Currently, licensed vaccines contain different concentrations of antigen per millilitre. The appropriate manufacturer&#8217;s dosage should be adhered to.

                    <p>
                        Different hepatitis B vaccine products can be used to complete a primary immunisation course or, where indicated, as a booster dose in individuals who have
                        previously received another hepatitis B vaccine (Bush <em>et al.</em>, 1991).

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Schedule</div>

                    <p>There are many different immunisation regimes for hepatitis B vaccine (see page 175). Generally the schedule for hepatitis B or combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine consists of three doses, with or without a fourth booster dose. One exception involves the use of adult strength vaccines in children, where two doses of Ambirix&reg; or adult strength Engerix B&reg; (given at zero and six to twelve months) are acceptable in those aged 1-15 years and 11-15 years respectively.</p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Administration</div>

                    <p>
                        Hepatitis B vaccines are routinely given intramuscularly in the upper arm or anterolateral thigh. The buttock must not be used because vaccine efficacy may
                        be reduced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hepatitis B-containing vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as DTaP/IPV/Hib, hepatitis A, MMR, MenC, Td/IPV and other travel
                        vaccines. The vaccines should be given at a separate site, preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm
                        apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003). The site at which each vaccine was given should be noted in the individual&#146;s records.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For individuals with a bleeding disorder, vaccines should be given by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HBIG can be administered in the upper outer quadrant of the buttock or anterolateral thigh (see Chapter 4). If more than 3ml is to be given to young
                        children and infants, or more than 5ml to older children and adults, the immunoglobulin should be divided into smaller amounts and administered to
                        different sites. HBIG may be administered, at a different site, at the same time as hepatitis B vaccine.
                    </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Disposal</div>

                    <p>
                        Equipment used for vaccination, including used vials, ampoules, or partially discharged vaccines should be disposed of at the end of a session by sealing in a proper, puncture-resistant ‘sharps&#146; box according to local authority regulations and guidance in the technical memorandum 07-01 (Department of Health, 2006).

                    <p>
                        The objective of the immunisation programme is to provide a minimum of three doses of hepatitis B vaccine for individuals at high risk of exposure to the
                        virus or complications of the disease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pre-exposure immunisation is used for individuals who are at increased risk of hepatitis B because of their lifestyle, occupation or other factors.
                        Immediate post-exposure vaccination is used to prevent infection, especially in babies born to infected mothers or following needlestick injuries (see
                        below).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where testing for markers of current or past infection is clinically indicated, this should be done at the same time as the administration of the first
                        dose. Vaccination should not be delayed while waiting for results of the tests. Further doses may not be required in those with clear evidence of past
                        exposure. Pre-exposure immunisation is recommended for the following groups.

                        Sexual partners are most at risk, and they and close household contacts should be vaccinated. Blood should be taken at the time of the first dose of
                        vaccine to determine if they have already been infected. Contacts shown to be HBsAg, anti-HBs or anti-HBc positive do not require further immunisation.
                        Advice regarding the appropriate use of condoms should be given; a reasonable level of protection can be assumed following the second dose, provided that
                        completion of the schedule can be assured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contacts who have had recent unprotected sex with individuals who have acute hepatitis B or who are HBsAg positive require post-exposure prophylaxis,
                        including HBIG (see below).

                    <p>Members of such families may be at risk, as these children could be chronically infected (Christenson, 1986; Rudin et al., 1990). When the status of the child to be adopted is not known, families adopting children from any high or intermediate-prevalence country should be advised as to the risks and hepatitis B vaccination recommended. In due course, testing such children is advisable because there could be benefits from referring an infected child for further management.</p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Foster carers</div>

                    <p>Some children requiring fostering may have been at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection. Emergency placements may be made within a few hours: foster carers who accept children as emergency placements should be made aware of the risks of undiagnosed infection and how they can minimise the risks of transmission of all blood-borne virus infections. All short-term foster carers who receive emergency placements, and their families, should be offered immunisation against hepatitis B. Permanent foster carers (and their families) who accept a child known to be at high risk of hepatitis B should also be offered immunisation.</p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Individuals receiving regular blood or blood products and their carers</div>

                    <p>Those individuals receiving regular blood products, such as people with haemophilia, should be vaccinated. Those receiving regular blood transfusions, for example people with thalassaemia or other chronic anaemia, should be vaccinated against hepatitis B. Carers responsible for the administration of such products should also be vaccinated</p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Patients with chronic renal failures</div>

                    <p>
                        Patients with renal failure may need haemodialysis, at which time they may be at increased risk of hepatitis B. The response to hepatitis B vaccine among
                        patients with renal failure is lower than among healthy adults. Between 45 and 66% of patients with chronic renal failure develop anti-HBs responses and,
                        compared with immunocompetent individuals, levels of anti-HBs decline more rapidly. However, increased response rates have been reported in vaccines
                        formulated for use in patients with chronic renal failure (Tong <em>et al</em>., 2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Immunisation against hepatitis B is recommended for patients already on haemodialysis or renal transplantation programmes and for other patients with
                        chronic renal failure as soon as it is anticipated that they may require these interventions. The vaccines formulated for use in patients with chronic
                        renal insufficiency should be used.
                    </p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Patients with chronic liver disease</div>

                    <p>Individuals with chronic liver disease may be at increased risk of the consequences of hepatitis B infection. Immunisation against hepatitis B is therefore recommended for patients with severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, of whatever cause. Vaccine should also be offered to individuals with milder liver disease, particularly those who are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus, who may share risk factors that mean that they are at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection.</p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Inmates of custodial institutions</div>

                    <p>Immunisation against hepatitis B is recommended for all sentenced prisoners and all new inmates entering prison in the UK. </p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Individuals in residential accommodation for those with learning difficulties </div>

                    <p>
                        A higher prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection has been found among individuals with learning difficulties in residential accommodation than in the
                        general population. Close, daily living contact and the possibility of behavioural problems may lead to residents being at increased risk of infection.
                        Vaccination is therefore recommended.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similar considerations may apply to children and adults in day care, schools and centres for those with severe learning disability. Decisions on
                        immunisation should be made on the basis of a local risk assessment. In settings where the individual&#146;s behaviour is likely to lead to significant exposure
                        (e.g. biting or being bitten) on a regular basis, immunisation should be offered to individuals even in the absence of documented hepatitis B transmission.
                    </p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">People travelling to or going to reside in areas of high or intermediate prevalence </div>

                    <p>
                        Travellers to areas of high or intermediate prevalence who place themselves at risk when abroad should be offered immunisation. The behaviours that place
                        them at risk will include sexual activity, injecting drug use, undertaking relief aid work and/or participating in contact sports. Travellers are also at
                        risk of acquiring infection as a result of medical or dental procedures carried out in countries where unsafe therapeutic injections (e.g. the re-use of
                        contaminated needles and syringes without sterilisation) are a risk factor for hepatitis B (Kane <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Simonsen <em>et al.</em>, 1999).
                        Individuals at high risk of requiring medical or dental procedures in such countries should therefore be immunised, including:

                    <p>
                        Hepatitis B infection can be transmitted from infected mothers to their babies at or around the time of birth (perinatal transmission). Babies acquiring
                        infection at this time have a high risk of becoming chronically infected with the virus. The development of the chronic infection after perinatal
                        transmission can be prevented in over 90% of cases by appropriate vaccination, starting at birth, of all infants born to infected mothers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UK guidelines (Department of Health, 1998) recommend that all pregnant women should be offered screening for hepatitis B infection during each pregnancy.
                        Confirmatory testing and testing for hepatitis B e-markers of those mothers shown to be infected should follow. Where an unbooked mother presents in
                        labour, an urgent HBsAg test should be performed to ensure that vaccine can be given to babies born to positive mothers within 24 hours of birth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Management of the infant should be based on the results of these markers and, if available, HBV viral load testing of the mother.
                        <a> href=” http://www.hpa.org.

                    <p>
                        All babies born to these mothers should receive a complete course of vaccine on time. Arrangements should be in place to ensure that information is shared
                        with appropriate local agencies to facilitate follow up.
                    </p>

                    <p>Babies born to highly infectious mothers should receive HBIG as well as active immunisation (see Table 18.4). HBIG should preferably be given within 24
                        hours of delivery, and should be ordered well in advance of the birth. HBIG may be given simultaneously with vaccine but at a different site. </p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Vaccination of pre-term babies</div>

                    <p>
                        There is evidence that the response to hepatitis B vaccine is lower in pre-term, low-birth weight babies (Losonsky <em>et al</em>., 1999). It is,
                        therefore, important that premature infants receive the full paediatric dose of hepatitis B vaccine on schedule. Babies with a birthweight of 1500g or
                        less, born to mothers infected with hepatitis B, should receive HBIG in addition to the vaccine, regardless of the e-antigen status of the mother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important that premature infants have their immunisations at the appropriate chronological age, according to the schedule. The occurrence of apnoea
                        following vaccination is especially increased in infants who were born very prematurely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) who are in hospital should have respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs when given their first
                        immunisation, particularly those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. If the child has apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations after the first
                        immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital, with respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs Pfister <em>et al</em>., 2004; Ohlsson <em>et al</em>., 2004; Schulzke <em>et al</em>., 2005; Pourcyrous <em>et al</em>., 2007; Klein <em>et al</em>., 2008).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.
                    </p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Vaccination schedule and follow-up</div>

                    <p>For post-exposure prophylaxis in babies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B, the accelerated immunisation schedule is preferred. For these babies this will mean an initial dose of vaccine at birth, with further doses at one and two months of age and a fourth dose at one year of age.
                        Testing for HBsAg at one year of age will identify any babies for whom this intervention has not been successful and who have become chronically infected with hepatitis B, and will allow them to be referred for assessment and any further management. This testing can be carried out at the same time as the fourth dose is given.
                        Where immunisation has been delayed beyond the recommended intervals, the vaccine course should be completed, but it is more likely that the child may become infected. In this instance, testing for HBsAg above the age of one year is particularly important. </p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Other groups potentially exposed to hepatitis B</div>

                    <p>Any individual potentially exposed to hepatitis B-infected blood or bodyfluids should be offered protection against hepatitis B, depending on their prior vaccination status and the status of the source www.hpa.org.uk/cdr/archives/CDRreview/1992/cdrr0992.pdf. Guidance on post-exposure prophylaxis following exposure to hepatitis B has been issued by the former PHLS Hepatitis Subcommittee (PHLS Hepatitis Subcommittee, 1992). A summary of this guidance is given in Table 18.5.</p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Sexual partners</div>

                    <p>Any sexual partner of individuals suffering from acute hepatitis B, and who are seen within one week of last contact, should be offered protection with HBIG and vaccine. Sexual contacts of an individual with newly diagnosed chronic hepatitis B should be offered vaccine; HBIG may be added if unprotected sexual contact occurred in the past week.</p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Persons who are accidentally inoculated or contaminated </div>

                    <p>This includes those who contaminate their eyes or mouth, or fresh cuts or abrasions of the skin, with blood from a known HBsAg-positive person. Individuals who sustain such accidents should wash the affected area well with soap and warm water, and seek medical advice. Advice about prophylaxis after such accidents should be obtained by telephone from the nearest public health laboratory or from the local Health Protection Team or virologist on call. Advice following accidental exposure may also be obtained from the occupational health services, hospital control of infection officer.</p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Pre-exposure prophylaxis </div>

                    <p>
                        For pre-exposure prophylaxis in most adult and childhood risk groups, an accelerated schedule should be used, with vaccine given at zero, one and two
                        months. Only for those infants who are at continued risk, a fourth dose is recommended at 12 months. An alternative schedule at zero, one and six months
                        should only be used where rapid protection is not required and there is a high likelihood of compliance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Higher completion rates are achieved with the accelerated schedule (at zero, one and two months) in groups where compliance is difficult (e.g. in IDUs and
                        genito-urinary medicine clinic attenders) (Asboe <em>et al</em>., 1996). This improved compliance is likely to offset the slightly reduced immunogenicity
                        when compared with the zero-, one- and six-month schedule, and similar response rates can be achieved by opportunistic use of a fourth dose after 12
                        months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the schedules outlined above, for children under 15 years of age, a two-dose schedule of a vaccine containing adult strength hepatitis B,
                        (Ambirix&reg; for those aged one to 15 years or Engerix B&reg; for those aged 11 to 15 years) at zero and six months provides similar protection to three doses of
                        the childhood hepatitis B vaccines (see page 167).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Engerix B&reg; can also be given at a very rapid schedule with three doses given at zero, seven and 21 days (Bock <em>et al</em>., 1995). When this schedule is
                        used, a fourth dose should be administered 12 months after the first dose for the individual to be considered protected. This schedule is licensed for use
                        in circumstances where adults over 18 years of age are at immediate risk and where a more rapid induction of protection is required. This includes persons
                        travelling to areas of high endemicity, IDUs and prisoners. In teenagers under 18 years of age, response to vaccine is as good or better than in older
                        adults (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004). Although not licensed for this age group, this schedule can be used in those aged 16 to 18 years where it is
                        important to provide rapid protection and to maximise compliance (e.g. IDUs and those in prison).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Twinrix Adult&reg; vaccine can also be given at zero, seven and 21 days. This will provide more rapid protection against hepatitis B than other schedules but
                        full protection against hepatitis A will be provided later than with vaccines containing a higher dose of hepatitis A (see Chapter 17). When this schedule
                        is used, a fourth dose should be administered 12 months after the first dose for the individual to be considered protected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fendrix&reg; is recommended to be given at zero, one, two and six months.
                    </p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Post-exposure prophylaxis </div>

                    <p>For post-exposure prophylaxis, an accelerated schedule of monovalent hepatitis B vaccine (or a combined vaccine of equivalent strength) should be used, with vaccine given at zero, one and two months. For those who are at continued risk, a fourth dose is recommended at 12 months. If HBIG is also indicated, it should be given as soon as possible, ideally at the same time as the first dose of vaccine. </p>

                    <div id="thirdhtitle">Reinforcing immunisation</div>

                    <p>
                        The full duration of protection afforded by hepatitis B vaccine has yet to be established (Whittle et al., 2002). Levels of vaccine-induced antibody to hepatitis B decline over time, but there is evidence that immune memory can persist in those successfully immunised (Liao et al., 1999). However, recent evidence suggests that not all individuals may respond in this way (Williams et al., 2003; Boxall et al., 2004). It is, therefore, recommended that individuals at continuing risk of infection should be offered a single booster dose of vaccine, once only, around five years after primary immunisation. Measurement of anti-HBs levels is not required either before or after this dose. Boosters are also recommended after exposure to the virus (as above).
                    </p>
                    <p>Because of the continued presence of infection in other family members, a single booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine, given with the pre-school booster for other childhood immunisations, is advised for the children born to hepatitis B infected-mothers. This will also provide the opportunity to check whether the child was properly followed up in infancy. </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Reinforcing immunisation in travellers</div>

                    <p>For travellers who have completed a primary course of vaccination, a single booster dose of vaccine at five years is not required, unless they are considered to be at continuing risk of infection.</p>

                    <div id="thirdhtitle">Response to vaccine and the use of additional doses</div>

                    <p>Except in certain groups (see below), testing for anti-HBs is not recommended.</p>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Those at risk of occupational exposure</div>

                    <p>
                        In those at risk of occupational exposure, particularly healthcare and laboratory workers, antibody titres should be checked one to four months after the
                        completion of a primary course of vaccine. Under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations, individual workers have the right to
                        know whether or not they have been protected. Such information allows appropriate decisions to be made concerning post-exposure prophylaxis following known
                        or suspected exposure to the virus (see above).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Antibody responses to hepatitis B vaccine vary widely between individuals. It is preferable to achieve anti-HBs levels above 100mIU/ml, although levels of
                        10mIU/ml or more are generally accepted as enough to protect against infection. Some anti-HBs assays are not particularly specific at the lower levels, and
                        anti-HBs levels of 100mIU/ml provide greater confidence that a specific response has been established.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Responders with anti-HBs levels greater than or equal to 100mIU/ml do not require any further primary doses. In immunocompetent individuals, once a
                        response has been established further assessment of antibody levels is not indicated. They should receive the reinforcing dose at five years as recommended
                        above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Responders with anti-HBs levels of 10 to 100mIU/ml should receive one additional dose of vaccine at that time. In immunocompetent individuals, further
                        assessment of antibody levels is not indicated. They should receive the reinforcing dose at five years as recommended above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An antibody level below 10mIU/ml is classified as a non-response to vaccine, and testing for markers of current or past infection is good clinical
                        practice. In non-responders, a repeat course of vaccine is recommended, followed by retesting one to four months after the second course. Those who still
                        have anti-HBs levels below 10mIU/ml, and who have no markers of current or past infection, will require HBIG for protection if exposed to the virus (see
                        below).

                    <p>The role of immunological memory in patients with chronic renal failure on renal dialysis does not appear to have been studied, and protection may persist only as long as anti-HBs levels remain above 10mIU/ml. Antibody levels should, therefore, be monitored annually and if they fall below 10mIU/ml, a booster dose of vaccine should be given to patients who have previously responded to the vaccine. </p>
                    <p>Booster doses should also be offered to any haemodialysis patients who are intending to visit countries with a high endemicity of hepatitis B and who have previously responded to the vaccine, particularly if they are to receive haemodialysis and have not received a booster in the last 12 months.</p>

                            Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be
                            postponed until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any signs or
                            symptoms to the adverse effects of the vaccine.

                        <p>Hepatitis B infection in pregnant women may result in severe disease for the mother and chronic infection of the newborn. Immunisation should not be withheld from a pregnant woman if she is in a high-risk category. There is no evidence of risk from vaccinating pregnant women or those who are breastfeeding with inactivated viral or bacterial vaccines or toxoids (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004). Since hepatitis B is an inactivated vaccine, the risks to the foetus are likely to be negligible, and it should be given where there is a definite risk of infection</p>

                        <div id="thirdtitle">Premature infants</div>
                        <p>There is evidence that the response to hepatitis B vaccine is lower in pre-term, low-birthweight babies (Losonsky et al., 1999). It is, therefore, important that premature infants receive the full paediatric dose of hepatitis B vaccine on schedule. Babies with a birthweight of 1500g or less, born to mothers infected with hepatitis B, should receive HBIG in addition to the vaccine, regardless of the e-antigen status of the mother.</p>

                        <p>
                            Hepatitis B vaccine may be given to HIV-infected individuals and should be offered to those at risk, since infection acquired by immunosuppressed, HIV-
                            positive patients can result in higher rates of chronic infection (Bodsworth <em>et al.</em>, 1991). Response rates are usually lower depending upon the
                            degree of immunosuppression (Newell and Nelson, 1998; Loke <em>et al.</em>, 1990). Increasing the number of doses may improve the anti-HBs response in
                            HIV-infected individuals (Rey <em>et al.</em>, 2000).

                        <p>When HBIG is being used for prevention of hepatitis B, it must be remembered that it may interfere with the subsequent development of active immunity from live virus vaccines. If immunoglobulin has been administered first, then an interval of three months should be observed before administering a live virus vaccine. If immunoglobulin has been given within three weeks of administering a live vaccine, then the vaccine should be repeated three months later. This does not apply to yellow fever vaccine since HBIG does not contain significant amounts of antibody to this virus. </p>

                            Hepatitis B vaccine is generally well tolerated and the most common adverse reactions are soreness and redness at the injection site. Other reactions that
                            have been reported but may not be causally related include fever, rash, malaise and an influenza-like syndrome, arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia and abnormal
                            liver function tests.

                        <p>
                            Serious suspected neurological reactions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and demyelinating disease have been reported, although these have been very rare
                            and a causal relationship with hepatitis B vaccine has not been established (Shaw <em>et al.</em>, 1988; McMahon <em>et al.</em>, 1992). The results of
                            recent studies indicate no association between hepatitis B immunisation and the development of multiple sclerosis (Ascherio <em>et al.</em>, 2001) and that
                            immunisation against hepatitis B does not increase the short-term risk of a relapse in patients with multiple sclerosis (Confavreux <em>et al.</em>, 2001).

                            All suspected reactions in children and severe suspected reactions in adults should be reported to the Commission on Human Medicines using the Yellow Card
