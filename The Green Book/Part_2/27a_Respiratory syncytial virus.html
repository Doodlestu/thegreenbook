              <p>
                  <p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the <i>Paramyxoviridae</i> family within the Pneumovirus genus. The virus has a non-segmented, single stranded, negative sense genome that encodes 11 proteins. Two surface glycoproteins on the virus (G and F) have important functions for helping the virus bind and fuse to cells. Glycoprotein G binds the virus to a host cell and F fuses the viral envelope with the host cell’s plasma membrane, so the virus can enter the host cell. The F protein also stimulates the fusion of the plasma membranes of the infected cells that results in the characteristic ‘syncytial’ pattern observed in tissue culture. Two major subtypes (A and B) of RSV have been identified based on structural variations in the G protein. The predominance of each subtype changes over successive seasons and is not associated with disease severity. The virus lacks neuraminidase and haemagglutinin surface glycoproteins that are present in the influenza virus (Black, 2003).</p>
                  <p>RSV is a common cause of respiratory tract infections. It usually causes a mild self-limiting respiratory infection in adults and children, but it can be severe in infants who are at increased risk of acute lower respiratory tract infection. RSV is best known for causing bronchiolitis in infants.</p>
                  <p>RSV is highly communicable but humans are the only known reservoir. The incubation period varies from two to eight days.  The virus is spread from respiratory secretions through close contact with infected persons via respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. By two years of age, nearly all children have been infected by RSV at least once (Henderson <i>et al</i>., 1979). Previous infection by RSV may only confer partial immunity to RSV and so individuals may be infected repeatedly with the same or different strains of RSV (Oshansky <i>et al</i>., 2009). </p>
                  <p>Predisposing factors for RSV infection include prematurity, cardiopulmonary disease, immunodeficiency, and may also include other factors such as tobacco exposure, day care attendance, overcrowding, lack of breastfeeding, and admission to hospital during the RSV season. Those infected by RSV experience a range of symptoms such as rhinitis (runny nose, sneezing or nasal congestion), cough, shortness of breath, fever, lethargy and decreased appetite. Symptoms can progress to croup, bronchiolitis and acute lower respiratory tract infection. Ear infections may also occur in children (Black, 2003).</p>
                  <p>It has been suggested that RSV infection may be associated with short- or long-term complications that include respiratory complications such as apnoea and hypoxemia, cardiovascular abnormalities, and bacterial infections (Leung <i>et al</i>., 2005). Children who have RSV bronchiolitis in early life may be at increased risk of developing asthma later in childhood, and at increased risk of recurrent wheezing (Sigurs <i>et al</i>., 2005). Those most at risk of developing severe, and occasionally fatal, RSV infection are very young infants born prematurely who have predisposing conditions such as chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease (CHD) or children who are immunodeficient (Wang <i>et al</i>., 2008).</p>
                  <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>
                  <p>RSV infection is a clearly identified winter virus (Health Protection Agency, 2005), usually occurring in the UK within the period October to March with most infections occurring in a relatively short epidemic of about six weeks. Whilst the occurrence of the mid-winter peak is predictable, its size varies from year to year (Figures 1 and 2).</p>
                  <p>The Health Protection Agency monitors levels of RSV activity in England and Wales and publishes information throughout the RSV season. The epidemiological data are included in the HPA Weekly Influenza Report (www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/SeasonalInfluenza/ EpidemiologicalData/) and the data also appears in the weekly <i>Health Protection Report</i> (www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/).</p>
                  <p>RSV surveillance data are gathered from hospital-based microbiology laboratory reports. The vast majority of specimens received for RSV testing are from children aged under one year, followed by those aged between one and four (Figure 3) (Health Protection Agency, 2010). Some data on RSV are also gathered as part of the Royal College of General Practitioners community based surveillance scheme of influenza-like illness.</p>
                  <p>Bronchiolitis is a common cause of hospitalisation in children aged under one year; about one to three per cent of RSV infected children require hospitalisation. In ‘high-risk’ children the mortality rate is about three per cent (Müller-Pebody <i>et al</i>., 2002). Pre-existing conditions, especially cardiac abnormalities and multiple co-morbidities, are associated with a significantly higher risk of death from severe RSV infection (Thorburn, 2009). RSV- associated mortality is highest in developing countries, but RSV can have a significant burden on the cost of care and the economy of all countries (Greenough <i>et al</i>., 2004; Nair <i>et al</i>., 2010). </p>

                <div id="fourthtitle">Synagis&reg</div>
                <p>Synagis&reg (Palivizumab) is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1<sub>1K</sub>) produced using recombinant DNA techniques in mouse myeloma host cells. It provides passive immunity against RSV. Palivizumab is directed against an epitope in the A antigenic site of the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Thus, the antibody targets the F protein of RSV that is responsible for fusing the virus and the host cell and therefore inhibits the virus from entering the host cell (Johnson <i>et al</i>., 1997, Harkensee <i>et al</i>., 2006). This passive immunisation has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing RSV hospitalisation rates and serious complications among high-risk children (Impact-RSV Study Group, 1998; Feltes <i>et al</i>., 2003). Palivizumab has a half- life in the body in the range of 18 to 21 days. Monthly administration during the RSV season is required to maintain its concentration at a protective level (Johnson, 1997).</p>
                <p>Synagis&reg is the only licensed form of Palivizumab (European Medicines Agency, 2010). The summary of product characteristics (SPC) (Electronic Medicines Compendium, 2010) states that it is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the following children at high risk for RSV disease, i.e.:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>children born at 35 weeks or less of gestation and under six months of age at the onset of the RSV season</span></li>
                    <li><span>children under two years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia within the previous six months</span></li>
                    <li><span>children under two years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The JCVI recommendations are under the ‘Recommendations for the use of the passive immunisation’ section.</p>
                <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>
                <p>Synagis&reg should be stored in the original packaging at +2°C to +8°C and protected from light. It needs to be handled in a similar way to vaccines, all of which are sensitive to some extent to heat and cold.  Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life.  Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless they have been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause loss of potency and can also cause hairline cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.</p>
                <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>
                <p>Presentation</p>
                <p>Synagis&reg is supplied as either 50mg or 100mg powder and solvent (1ml of water in an ampoule [type I glass]) for injection. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>50mg of powder in a 4ml vial (Type I glass) with a stopper (bromobutyl rubber)</span></li>
                    <li><span>100mg of powder in a 10ml vial (Type I glass) with a stopper (bromobutyl rubber)</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Instructions for mixing Synagis&reg are as given in the SPC as follows (Electronic Medicines Compendium, 2010) (Figure 4): </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>For the 50mg vial Synagis&reg slowly add 0.6ml of water from the ampoule provided along the inside wall of the vial to minimise foaming. There is an overage (extra powder) in each vial, which allows for 0.5ml from the 50mg vial to be withdrawn, so long as they have been reconstituted as per instructions. <br>For the 100mg vial Synagis&reg, slowly add 1.0ml of water from the ampoule provided along the inside wall of the vial to minimise foaming. For both preparations, the final reconstituted concentration is 100mg/ml.</span></li>
                    <li><span>After the water is added, tilt the vial slightly and gently rotate the vial for 30 seconds. Do not shake the vial.</span></li>
                    <li><span>The solution should stand at room temperature for a minimum of 20 minutes until the solution clarifies. The solution does not contain a preservative and should be administered within three hours of preparation. Any remaining contents should be discarded after use.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <div id="thirdtitle">Dosage and schedule</div>
                <p>The recommended dose of Synagis&reg is 15mg/kg of body weight, given once a month. Where possible, the first dose should be administered at the start of the RSV season (calendar week 40). Subsequent doses should be administered monthly throughout the RSV season up to a maximum of five doses.</p>
                <div id="thirdtitle">Administration</div>
                <p>Synagis&reg is given by intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. It can be given at the same time as vaccines administered as part of the routine childhood immunisation programme. The vaccines should be given at separate sites, preferably in a different limb.  If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003). The site at which each injection is given and the batch numbers of the immunisations should be recorded in the individual’s records.</p>
                <p>The summary of product characteristics for Synagis&reg states that ‘No formal interactions studies with other medicinal products were conducted, however no interactions have been described to date. In the phase III IMpact-RSV study in the premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations, the proportions of patients in the placebo and palivizumab groups who received routine childhood vaccines, influenza vaccine, bronchodilators or corticosteroids were similar and no incremental increase in adverse reactions was observed among patients receiving these agents.’ </p>
                <div id="thirdtitle">Disposal</div>
                <p>Equipment used for prophylaxis, including used vials, ampoules, or partially discharged product should be disposed of at the end of a session by sealing in a proper, puncture-resistant ‘sharps’box according to local authority regulations and guidance in the technical memorandum 07-01 (Department of Health, 2006).</p>

                <p>The objective of the passive immunisation is to protect at-risk pre-term infants for whom RSV infection is likely to cause serious illness or death. Synagis&reg is recommended for use in all infants in the following groups. This is based on an analysis of the cost effective use of Palivizumab prophylaxis (Wang <i>et al</i>., 2008, and <i>in press</i>).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Pre-term infants who have chronic lung disease (CLD) at the chronological ages at the start of the RSV season and gestational ages at birth covered within the shaded area of Table 1, Figure 5. The definition of CLD is oxygen dependency for at least 28 days from birth. Therefore, infants under one month of chronological age are excluded from Table 1, Figure 5.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Pre-term infants who have haemodynamically significant, acyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) at the chronological ages at the start of the RSV season and gestational ages covered within the shaded area in Table 2, Figure 5.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>A tool to assess when the use of Synagis&reg is recommended in the groups of infants identified above is available on the Department of Health website at www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Immunisation/Keyvaccineinformation/ DH_120246</p>
                <p>Synagis&reg should be considered during the RSV season for the following groups of infants:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>all children under the age of 24 months who have severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID), until immune reconstituted and;</span></li>
                    <li><span>all children who are on long term ventilation (LTV) aged under 12 months at the start of the RSV season and,</span></li>
                    <li><span>all children who are on LTV aged under 24 months at the start of the RSV season with additional co-pathology (heart disease/pulmonary hypertension, intrinsic lung disease (as reflected by oxygen dependency).</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>SCID is the most severe form of inherited deficiency of immunity. Affected infants are unable to mount either T-cell responses or produce antibody against infectious agents. The definition of LTV is ‘any child who when medically stable, continues to require a mechanical aid for breathing, after an acknowledged failure to wean three months after the institution of ventilation’ (Jardine and Wallis, 1998).</p>
                <p>Where clinical judgement of other individual patient circumstances strongly suggests that prophylaxis would prevent serious RSV infection in infants who are at particular risk of complications from RSV, use of Synagis&reg could be considered during the RSV season.</p>
                <p>Synagis&reg should be given as a maximum of five doses given one month apart from the beginning of the RSV season (beginning of calendar week 40 i.e. beginning of October). However, where the course of treatment begins later in the RSV season (e.g. where infants are born within the RSV season) up to five doses should be given one month apart until the end of calendar week 8 (i.e. the end of February).  As the risk of acquiring RSV infection while in the neonatal unit is extremely low, infants in neonatal units who are in the appropriate risk groups should only begin Synagis&reg treatment 24 to 48 hours before being discharged from hospital. Those infants that have begun a course of Synagis&reg treatment but are subsequently hospitalised should continue to receive Synagis® whilst they remain in hospital.</p>
                <p>Synagis&reg provides short-term protection against RSV and is recommended to all new at risk infants at the start of each new RSV season (as described above). If, during the RSV season, an infant is identified to be at risk but there is no reliable history of previous Synagis® prophylaxis within the season, then doses should be started and administered monthly for the remainder of the RSV season but need not be given after the end of calendar week 8.  Where courses have been interrupted the doses should be restarted and administered monthly for the remainder of the RSV season but need not be given after the end of calendar week 8.</p>
