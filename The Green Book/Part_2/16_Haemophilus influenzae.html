                    <p>
                        <i>Haemophilus influenzae </i>can cause serious invasive disease, especially in young children. Invasive disease is usually caused by encapsulated strains of the organism. Six typeable capsular serotypes (a-f) are known to cause disease; non-typeable encapsulated strains can occasionally cause invasive disease. Before the introduction of vaccination, type b (Hib) was the prevalent strain. The proportion of typeable to non-typeable strains depends largely on the prevalence of the type b strain. Non-encapsulated strains are mainly associated with respiratory infections such as exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and otitis media.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most common presentation of invasive Hib disease is meningitis, frequently accompanied by bacteraemia. This presentation accounts for approximately 60%
                        of all cases (Anderson <em>et al.</em>, 1995). Fifteen per cent of cases present with epiglottitis, a potentially dangerous condition that presents with
                        airway obstruction. Bacteraemia, without any other concomitant infection, occurs in 10% of cases. The remainder is made up of cases of septic arthritis,
                        osteomyelitis, cellulitis, pneumonia and pericarditis. The sequelae following Hib meningitis may include deafness, seizures, and intellectual impairment.
                        In studies conducted in Wales and Oxford, 8 to 11% had permanent neurological sequelae (Howard <em>et al.</em>, 1991; Tudor-Williams <em>et al.</em>,
                        1989). The case fatality rate from Hib meningitis is 4-5%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Individuals can carry Hib bacteria in their nose and throat without showing signs of the disease. Before Hib vaccine was introduced, about four in every
                        100 pre-school children carried the Hib organism; after the vaccine was introduced, carriage rates fell below the level of detection (McVernon <em>et al.</em>, 2004). Hib is spread through coughing, sneezing or close contact with a carrier or an infected person.
                    </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>

                    <p>
                        Before the introduction of Hib immunisation, the estimated annual incidence of invasive Hib disease was 34 per 100,000 children under five years of age.
                        One in every 600 children developed some form of invasive Hib disease before their fifth birthday (Booy <em>et al.</em>, 1994). The disease was rare in
                        children under three months of age, but the incidence rose progressively during the first year, reaching a peak between 10 and 11 months of age.
                        Thereafter, the incidence declined steadily to four years of age after which infection was uncommon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vaccines against Hib were first produced in the early 1970s and they contained purified capsular polysaccharide. These vaccines were effective in children
                        over 18 months of age, but failed to protect younger children, in whom the risk of disease was highest. The development of conjugate Hib vaccines overcame
                        this problem. In conjugate vaccines, the capsular polysaccharides were linked to proteins, improving the vaccines immunogenicity, particularly in children
                        less than one year of age. In 1992, Hib conjugate vaccine was introduced into the routine UK immunisation schedule. Hib conjugate vaccine was originally
                        administered as a separate vaccine. In 1996, combination vaccines (DTwP/ Hib) were introduced, and in 2004, Hib vaccine combined with DTaP and IPV
                        (DTaP/IPV/Hib) became available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The efficacy and safety of the conjugate Hib vaccines have been demonstrated in large field trials in Finland, the United States and in the UK, where
                        efficacy ranged from 83 to 100% (Black <em>et al.</em>, 1991a; Black <em>et al.</em>, 1991b; Eskola <em>et al.</em>, 1990). Studies comparing different
                        vaccines, using the present UK primary schedule, have shown that 90 to 99% of children developed protective levels of antibodies following three doses of
                        vaccine (Booy <em>et al.</em>, 1994). Cases of invasive disease in fully vaccinated children (vaccine failures) have been reported from some countries,
                        including the UK (Heath and McVernon, 2002). A small proportion of such cases have underlying conditions, such as immunoglobulin deficiency, predisposing
                        the child to vaccine failure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the introduction of Hib immunisation in the UK, disease incidence has fallen (see Figure 16.1). In 1998, only 21 cases of invasive Hib were reported
                        in England and Wales in children under five years of age (0.65 per 100,000) compared with 803 in 1991 (20.5 per 100,000). In infants under one year of age,
                        the highest risk age group for disease, reported cases fell by over 95% (from 300 to 7). Notifications of <em>H. influenzae </em>meningitis for the same
                        period declined from 485 to 29. In 1998, coverage by the second birthday was 95%.

                    <p>
                        From 1999, there was a small but gradual increase in the number of cases of Hib disease reported, mostly in children less than four years of age. However,
                        this increase was most notable among children born in 2000 and 2001 (McVernon <em>et al.</em>, 2003). Reasons for this increase in vaccine failures are
                        thought to include an effect of the DTaP/Hib combination vaccine which was in use at that time and a waning of the impact of the catch-up programme when
                        the vaccine was introduced. In this latter group, who were immunised at an older age, the efficacy was higher than in children vaccinated routinely as
                        infants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2003, a booster campaign was implemented with call-back of children aged six months to four years (Chief Medical Officer <em>et al</em>., 2004).
                        Following the campaign, cases have begun to return to the low levels achieved previously (see Figure 16.1). In 2006, following studies that showed that
                        protection against Hib waned during the second year of life (Trotter <em>et al</em>., 2003), a booster dose (combined with MenC as Hib/MenC) was
                        introduced.

                        Hib-containing vaccines are made from capsular polysaccharide that has been extracted from cultures of Hib bacteria. The polysaccharide is linked
                        (conjugated) to a protein, according to the manufacturer's methodology. In the UK, Hib vaccines have been used that have been conjugated with either CRM <sub>197 </sub>(a non-toxic variant of diphtheria toxin) or tetanus toxoid. The conjugation increases the immunogenicity, especially in young children, in
                        whom the plain polysaccharide vaccines are not immunogenic.

                        Some DTaP/Hib combination vaccines have been shown to attenuate the Hib response in comparison with DTwP/Hib combinations (Trotter <em>et al.</em>, 2003).
                        The Hib-containing vaccine (Pediacel) chosen for primary immunisation in the UK programme has been shown not to have this problem (Miller <em>et al.</em>,
                        2003).

                        The Hib/MenC conjugate vaccine is made from capsular polysaccharides of <em>H. influenzae</em> type b and group C <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>, which
                        are conjugated to tetanus toxoid. The vaccine has been shown to elicit booster responses to both Hib and MenC when given in the second year of life to

                    <p>
                        Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at &#43;2&degC to &#43;8&degC and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat and cold.
                        Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless they have
                        been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause hairline
                        cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.

                        Hib vaccines are available as part of combined products DTaP/IPV/Hib or Hib/MenC. The combined product, DTaP/IPV/Hib is supplied as a cloudy white
                        suspension either in a single dose ampoule or pre-filled syringe. The suspension may sediment during storage and should be shaken to distribute the
                        suspension uniformly before administration.

                        Hib/MenC is supplied as a vial of white powder and 0.5ml of solvent in a pre-filled syringe. The vaccine must be reconstituted by adding the entire
                        contents of the pre-filled syringe to the vial containing the powder. After addition of the solvent, the mixture should be shaken well until the powder is
                        completely dissolved. After reconstitution, the vaccine should be administered promptly, or allowed to stand between +2&degC and +8&degC and used within 24
                        hours.

                    <p>

                        Vaccines are routinely given intramuscularly into the upper arm or anterolateral thigh. This is to reduce the risk of localised reactions, which are more
                        common when vaccines are given subcutaneously (Mark <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Diggle and Deeks, 2000; Zuckerman, 2000). However, for individuals with a
                        bleeding disorder, vaccines should be given by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hib-containing vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as MMR, MenC, hepatitis B, and pneumococcal. The vaccines should be given at a
                        separate site, preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003).
                        The site at which each vaccine was given should be noted in the patient's records.

                        from invasive Hib disease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To fulfil this objective, the appropriate vaccine for each age group is determined also by the need to protect individuals against diphtheria, tetanus,
                        pertussis, Hib and polio.

                    </p>

                    <p>The primary course of Hib vaccination in infants consists of three doses of a Hib-containing product with an interval of one month between each dose. DTaP/IPV/Hib is recommended for all children from two months up to ten years of age. Although one dose of Hib vaccine is effective from one year of age, three doses of DTaP/IPV/Hib should be given to children who have either not been immunised or who have not completed a primary course, in order to be fully protected against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio. If the primary course is interrupted it should be resumed but not repeated, allowing an interval of one month between the remaining doses.</p>
                       <p> Children of one to ten years of age who have completed a primary course of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio but have not received Hib-containing vaccines, should receive a single dose of Hib/MenC vaccine. </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Reinforcing immunisation</div>

                    <p>A reinforcing (booster) dose of Hib/MenC is recommended at 12 months for children who have received a complete primary course of three Hib-containing vaccine injections. The Hib/MenC vaccine can be given at the same time as the pneumococcal conjugate and MMR vaccines. </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Vaccination of children with unknown or incomplete immunisation status </div>

                    <p>
                        Where a child born in the UK presents with an inadequate immunisation history, every effort should be made to clarify what immunisations they may have had
                        (see Chapter 11, on immunisation schedule). A child who has not completed the primary course should have the outstanding doses at monthly intervals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Children coming to the UK who have a history of completing immunisation in their country of origin may not have been offered protection against all the
                        antigens currently used in the UK. They may not have received Hib-containing
						 vaccines in their country of origin (www-nt.who.int/immunization_monitor ing/en/globalsummary/countryprofileselect.cfm).

                    <p>
                        Children coming from developing countries, from areas of conflict, or from hard-to-reach population groups may not have been fully immunised. Where there
                        is no reliable history of previous immunisation, it should be assumed that they are unimmunised and the full UK recommendations should be followed (see
                        Chapter 11).

                    <p>
                        Children and adults with asplenia or splenic dysfunction may be at increased risk of invasive Hib infection. Children and adults with early complement
                        deficiency (e.g. C1, 2, 3 or 4 deficiencies) may also be at increased risk of invasive Hib infection (Figueroa <em>et al., </em>1991).

                    <p>
                        Given the increased risk, additional vaccinations against Hib disease are advised for individuals who develop asplenia or splenic dysfunction or when
                        complement deficiency is diagnosed depending on age and vaccination history. For the full list of immunisations for these groups, see Table 7.1 in chapter

                        These individuals should be vaccinated according to the UK routine childhood schedule, which includes a booster of Hib/MenC and PCV given at 12 months of
                        age. A dose of MenACWY conjugate vaccine should be given at least one month after the Hib/MenC and PCV boosters.

                    <p>
                        After the second birthday, an additional dose of Hib/MenC should be given. If the individual received their routine pneumococcal booster dose as PCV7 (before April 2010) an additional dose of PCV13 should be offered at the same
                        time, followed by a dose of PPV two months later. If the child was routinely boosted with PCV13 (after April 2010) a dose of PPV should be given with the
                        Hib/MenC booster.

                    <p>There are very few individuals who cannot receive Hib-containing vaccines. Where there is doubt, appropriate advice should be sought from a consultant paediatrician, immunisation co-ordinator or consultant in communicable disease control rather than withhold vaccine. </p>

Other allergic conditions may occur more commonly and are not contraindications to further immunisation. A careful history of the event will often distinguish between anaphylaxis and other events that are either not due to the vaccine or are not life-threatening. In the latter circumstance, it may be possible to continue the immunisation course. Specialist advice must be sought on the vaccines and circumstances in which they could be given. The risk to the individual of not being immunised must be taken into account.</p>

                    <p>Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be postponed until they have recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any signs or symptoms to the adverse effects of the vaccine. </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Systemic and local reactions following a previous immunisation </div>

                    <p>This section gives advice on the immunisation of children with a history of a severe or mild systemic or local reaction within 72 hours of a preceding vaccine. Immunisation with Hib-containing vaccine should continue following a history of: </p>

                    </ul>

                    <p>In Canada, a severe general or local reaction to DTaP/IPV/Hib is not a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine (Canadian Medical Association, 1998). Adverse events after childhood immunisation are carefully monitored in Canada (Le Saux <i>et al</i>., 2003) and their experience suggests that further doses were not associated with recurrence or worsening of the preceding events (S Halperin and R Pless, pers. comm., 2003). </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Pregnancy and Breast-feeding </div>

                    <p>Hib-containing vaccines may be given to pregnant women when protection is required without delay. There is no evidence of risk from vaccinating pregnant women or those who are breast-feeding with inactivated viral or bacterial vaccines or toxoids (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004). </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Premature Infants </div>

                    <p>
                        It is important that premature infants have their immunisations at the appropriate chronological age, according to the schedule. The occurrence of apnoea
                        following vaccination is especially increased in infants who were born very prematurely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Very premature infants (born  &lt;28 weeks of gestation) who are in hospital should have respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs when given their first
                        immunisation, particularly those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. If the child has apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations after the first
                        immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital, with respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs (Pfister <em>et al</em>., 2004; Ohlsson <em>et al</em>., 2004; Schulzke <em>et al</em>., 2005; Pourcyrous <em>et al</em>., 2007; Klein <em>et al</em>., 2008).

                    <p>
                        As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.

                        Individuals with immunosuppression and HIV infection (regardless of CD4 count) should be given Hib-containing vaccines in accordance with the
                        recommendations above. These individuals may not make a full antibody response. Re-immunisation should be considered after treatment is finished and
                        recovery has occurred. Specialist advice may be required.

                        The presence of a neurological condition is not a contraindication to immunisation. Where there is evidence of a neurological condition in a child, the
                        advice given in the flow chart in Figure 16.2 should be followed.

                        If a child has a stable pre-existing neurological abnormality such as spina bifida, congenital abnormality of the brain or perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic
                        encephalopathy, they should be immunised according to the recommended schedule. When there has been a documented history of cerebral damage in the neonatal
                        period, immunisation should be carried out unless there is evidence of an evolving neurological abnormality.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        If there is evidence of current neurological deterioration, including poorly controlled epilepsy, immunisation should be deferred and the child should be
                        referred to a child specialist for investigation to see if an underlying cause can be identified. If a cause is not identified, immunisation should be
                        deferred until the condition has stabilised. If a cause is identified, immunisation should proceed as normal.

                    <p>
                        A family history of seizures is not a contraindication to immunisation. When there is a personal or family history of febrile seizures, there is an
                        increased risk of these occurring after any fever, including that caused by immunisation.

                        Seizures associated with fever are rare in the first six months of life and most common in the second year of life. After this age, the frequency falls and
                        they are rare after five years of age.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a child has had a seizure associated with fever in the past, with no evidence of neurological deterioration, immunisation should proceed as
                        recommended. Advice on the prevention and management of fever should be given before immunisation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a child has had a seizure that is not associated with fever, and there is no evidence of neurological deterioration, immunisation should proceed as
                        recommended. When immunised with DTP vaccine, children with a family or personal history of seizures had no significant adverse events and their
                        developmental progress was normal (Ramsay <em>et al., </em>1994).

                        If a child experiences encephalopathy or encephalitis within seven days of immunisation, the advice in the flow chart in Figure 16.3 should be followed. It
                        is unlikely that these conditions will have been caused by the vaccine and should be investigated by a specialist. Immunisation should be deferred in
                        children where no underlying cause is found and the child does not recover completely within seven days, until the condition has stabilised. If a cause is
                        identified or the child recovers within seven days, immunisation should proceed as recommended.
                    </p>
                    

                    <p>If a seizure associated with a fever occurs within 72 hours of an immunisation, further immunisation should be deferred until the condition is stable if no underlying cause has been found and the child does not recover completely within 24 hours. If a cause is identified or the child recovers within 24 hours, immunisation should continue as recommended. </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Deferral of Immunisation </div>

                    <p>There will be very few occasions when deferral of immunisation is required (see above). Deferral leaves the child unprotected; the period of deferral should be minimised so that immunisation can commence as soon as possible. If a specialist recommends deferral, this should be clearly communicated to the general practitioner and he or she must be informed as soon as the child is fit for immunisation. </p>

                    <p>Pain, swelling or redness at the injection site are common and may occur more frequently following subsequent doses. A small, painless nodule may form at the injection site; this usually disappears and is of no consequence. The incidence of local reactions is lower with tetanus vaccines combined with acellular pertussis vaccines than with whole-cell pertussis vaccines, and similar to that after diphtheria (DT) vaccine (Miller, 1999; Tozzi and Olin, 1997).</p>

                        Confirmed anaphylaxis occurs extremely rarely. Data from the UK, Canada and the US point to rates of 0.65 to 3 anaphylaxis events per million doses of
                        vaccine given (Bohlke <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Canadian Medical Association, 2002). Other allergic conditions may occur more commonly and are not
                        contraindications to further immunisation.

                        Unimmunised cases up to the age of ten years should be immunised according to their age-appropriate schedule after recovery from infection. Previously
                        vaccinated cases should have their convalescent antibody levels measured, and booster vaccination may be advised. Where antibody testing is not possible,
                        an additional dose of Hib-containing vaccine should be given after recovery from infection.

                        Household contacts of a case of invasive Hib disease have an increased risk of contracting the disease. Unimmunised children under ten years of age are at
                        substantial risk. Contacts of cases should be managed following the advice of the local health protection unit, as follows:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>children who have never received any immunisations should receive three doses of DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine if below ten years of age. </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>children who have never received Hib vaccine, but who have been immunised against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio, should receive three doses of Hib/MenC vaccine if under one year, and one dose if aged between one and ten years. </span>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>children aged between one and ten years who have received Hib vaccine in infancy, but who did not receive a booster dose of Hib containing vaccine after the age of 12 months, should receive a single dose of Hib/ MenC vaccine. </span>
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Where there is any individual in the household of a case who is also at risk, the index case and all household contacts should be given rifampicin
                        prophylaxis. Those at risk in the household include all children under ten years of age and vulnerable individuals of any age (e.g. those who are
                        immunosuppressed or asplenic) regardless of their immunisation status. The purpose of this recommendation is to prevent transmission of Hib to vulnerable
                        individuals within a household. Further information is available at:

                    <p>
                        When a case occurs in a playgroup, nursery, cr&egrave;che or school, the opportunity should be taken to identify and vaccinate any unimmunised children under ten
                        years of age. When two or more cases of Hib disease have occurred in a playgroup, nursery, cr&egrave;che or school within 120 days, chemoprophylaxis should be
                        offered to all room contacts - teachers and children. This is a precautionary measure as there is little evidence that children in such settings are at
                        significantly higher risk of Hib disease than the general population of the same age.
