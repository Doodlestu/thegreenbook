                        <p>
                            Pneumococcal disease is the term used to describe infections caused by the bacterium <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>(also called pneumococcus).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>S. pneumoniae</em> is an encapsulated Gram-positive coccus. The capsule is the most important virulence factor of <em>S. pneumoniae</em>; pneumococci that lack the capsule
                            are normally not virulent. Over 90 different capsular types have been characterised. Prior to routine conjugate vaccination, around 66% of the serious
                            infections in adults and 80% of invasive infections in children were caused by eight to ten capsular types (Health Protection Agency, 2003).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some serotypes of the pneumococcus may be carried in the nasopharynx without symptoms, with disease occurring in a small proportion of infected
                            individuals. Other serotypes are rarely identified in the nasopharynx but are associated with invasive disease. The incubation period for pneumococcal
                            disease is not clearly defined but it may be as short as one to three days. The organism may spread locally into the sinuses or middle ear cavity, causing
                            sinusitis or otitis media. It may also affect the lungs to cause pneumonia, or cause systemic (invasive) infections including bacteraemic pneumonia,
                            bacteraemia and meningitis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Transmission is by aerosol, droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions of someone carrying the organism. Transmission usually requires either
                            frequent or prolonged close contact. There is a seasonal variation in pneumococcal disease, with peak levels in the winter months.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Invasive pneumococcal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It particularly affects the very young, the elderly, those with an absent or
                            non-functioning spleen and those with other causes of impaired immunity. Recurrent infections may occur in association with skull defects, cerebrospinal
                            fluid (CSF) leaks, cochlear implants or fractures of the skull.
                        </p>

                        Currently, the pneumococcus is one of the most frequently reported causes of bacteraemia and meningitis. During 2005, 6207 laboratory isolates from Figure
                        25.1 Weekly number of invasive pneumococcal disease cases in England and Wales (1996-2005) blood, CSF or other normally sterile sites were reported to the
                        Health Protection Agency Centre for Infection (HPA CfI) from laboratories in England and Wales (Health Protection Agency, 2010). Figure 25.1 shows the
                        weekly number of invasive pneumococcal disease cases in England and Wales between 1996 and 2005. The pneumococcus is also the commonest cause of community-
                        acquired pneumonia (Bartlett and Mundy, 1995). Pneumococcal pneumonia is estimated to affect one in a thousand adults each year and has a case fatality
                        ratio of 10 to 20% (World Health Organization, 1999).

                        Antimicrobial resistance among pneumococci occurs and susceptibility to macrolide antimicrobials, penicillin and cephalosporin can no longer be assumed. In
                        2000, 13% of invasive isolates in England and Wales reported to the HPA CDSC were resistant to erythromycin and 7% showed full or intermediate resistance
                        to penicillin (George and Melegaro, 2001, 2003). An increase in pneumococcal antibiotic resistance has been reported worldwide (Appelobaum, 1992; Butler <em>et al</em>., 1996; Davies <em>et al</em>., 1999).

                    <p>
                        Since 1992, pneumococcal polysaccharide immunisation (see below) has been recommended for people with medical conditions for whom pneumococcal infection
                        was likely to be more common or serious.

                        In recent years, the pneumococcal vaccination recommendations have undergone a number of changes:

                        Most healthy adults develop a good antibody response to a single dose of PPV by the third week following immunisation. Antibody response may be reduced in
                        those with immunological impairment and those with an absent or dysfunctional spleen. Children younger than two years of age show poor antibody responses
                        to immunisation with PPV.

                        It is difficult to reach firm conclusions about the effectiveness of PPV, but overall efficacy in preventing pneumococcal bacteraemia is probably 50 to 70%
                        (Mangtani <em>et al</em>., 2003; Fedson, 1999; Fine <em>et al</em>., 1994; Butler <em>et al</em>., 1993; Melegaro and Edmunds, 2004). Current evidence
                        suggests that PPV is not effective in protecting against non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia (Jackson <em>et al</em>., 2003). It does not prevent otitis
                        media or exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The vaccine is relatively ineffective in patients with multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
                        (especially during treatment) and chronic alcoholism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The vaccine does not protect against pneumococcal infection due to capsular types not contained in the vaccine, but the 23 types included account for about
                        96% of the pneumococcal isolates that cause serious infection in the UK (Health Protection Agency, 2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The length of protection is not known and may vary between capsular types. Post-immunisation antibody levels usually begin to wane after about five years,
                        but may decline more rapidly in asplenic patients and children with nephrotic syndrome (Butler <em>et al</em>., 1993).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no evidence of effectiveness of PPV in children under two years of age (Fedson <em>et al</em>., 1999).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The antibody response in young children can be improved by conjugating the polysaccharide to proteins such as CRM197. The conjugated vaccine is known to be
                        immunogenic in children from two months of age. Data on immunogenicity comes from four studies using the UK childhood immunisation schedule of a primary
                        course of two doses, at least two months apart, and a third dose in the second year of life. In a study conducted in the UK comparing the seven valent
                        (Prevenar<sup>&#174;</sup>) and thirteen valent (Prevenar13<sup>&#174;</sup>) PCV, the functional antibody responses were comparable for all serotypes
                        common to both vaccines (Wyeth, 2010). Studies have also shown good functional antibody responses to the additional six serotypes in the thirteen valent
                        PCV (Prevenar13<sup>&#174;</sup>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Post-licensure surveillance, following introduction of the seven valent PCV in the UK in 2006 as part of a universal infant immunisation programme, has
                        shown a large reduction in both invasive and non-invasive disease incidence due to vaccine serotypes in both vaccinated and to a smaller degree in older
                        unvaccinated populations ('herd protection')(HPA website, 2010). During the same period, the UK has seen an increase in invasive disease due to non-vaccine serotypes (termed 'serotype replacement')(HPA website, 2010).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Replacement disease has been caused in a large part by the extra six serotypes which are now covered by PCV13 that replaced PCV7 in 2010.

                        Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&degC to +8&degC and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat
                        and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless
                        they have been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause
                        hairline cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.

                        Vaccines are routinely given into the upper arm in children and adults or the anterolateral thigh in infants under one year of age. This is to reduce the
                        risk of localised reactions, which are more common when vaccines are given subcutaneously (Mark <em>et al</em>., 1999; Diggle and Deeks, 2000; Zuckerman,
                        2000). However, for individuals with a bleeding disorder, vaccines should be given by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pneumococcal vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as DTaP/IPV/Hib, MMR, MenC, Hib/MenC and influenza. The vaccines should be given
                        at separate sites, preferably in different limbs. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics,
                        2003) (see chapter 11). The site at which each vaccine was given should be noted in the individual's records.

                        A reinforcing (booster) dose of PCV13 is recommended at 12 months of age for children who have received a complete primary course of two PCVs. This vaccine

                        Rytel <em>et al</em>., 1986) and therefore re-immunisation with PPV23 is recommended every five years in these groups. Revaccination is well tolerated
                        (Jackson <em>et al</em>., 1999). Testing of antibody levels prior to vaccination is not required.

                        Although there is evidence of a decline in protection with time (Shapiro <em>et al</em>., 1991), there are no studies showing additional protection from
                        boosting individuals with other indications, including age, and therefore routine revaccination is not currently recommended.

                        Individuals who have previously received a 12 -or 14-valent PPV should be immunised with PPV23 to gain protection from the additional serotypes.

                        of PCV13. At risk children in this group who are previously unvaccinated or partially vaccinated (including those who only received PCV7) should receive
                        one dose of PCV13, followed by PPV23 at least two months later.

                    <p>
                        Children in this age group who have asplenia or splenic dysfunction, or who are immunocompromised, may have a sub-optimal immunological response to
                        vaccination. If fully vaccinated, these children should receive one dose of PCV13 followed by PPV23 at least two months later. Children who are previously
                        unvaccinated or partially vaccinated (including those who only received PCV7) should receive two doses of PCV13 at least two months apart, followed by
                        PPV23 at least two months later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    At-risk children who are eligible for one or two doses of PCV13 (as above) but who have already received PPV23 should wait at least six months after the
                    PPV23 dose to receive PCV13 in order to reduce the theoretical risk of pneumococcal serotype-specific hypo-responsiveness.

                    <p>
                        For leukaemia patients, PCV13 should be given from six months after completion of chemotherapy, and for bone marrow transplant patients, PCV13 should be
                        offered 9-12 months following transplantation.

                        All children aged five years and above and adults in a clinical risk group other than those who are severely immunocompromised (see Table 25.2) should

                        Previously unvaccinated children and adults requiring splenectomy or commencing immunosuppressive treatment may be at an increased risk of pneumococcal
                        disease and should be vaccinated according to the schedule for this specific risk group.

                    <p>
                        Ideally, pneumococcal vaccine should be given four to six weeks before Pneumococcal elective splenectomy or initiation of treatment such as chemotherapy or
                        radiotherapy. Where this is not possible, it can be given up to two weeks before treatment. If it is not possible to vaccinate beforehand, splenectomy,
                        chemotherapy or radiotherapy should never be delayed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If it is not practicable to vaccinate two weeks before splenectomy, immunisation should be delayed until at least two weeks after the operation. This is
                        because there is evidence that functional antibody responses may be better from this time (Shatz <em>et al</em>., 1998). If it is not practicable to
                        vaccinate two weeks before the initiation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, immunisation can be delayed until at least three months after completion of
                        therapy in order to maximise the response to the vaccine. Immunisation of these patients should not be delayed if this is likely to result in a failure to
                        vaccinate.

                        There is an association between exposure to metal fume and pneumonia and infectious pneumonia, particularly lobar pneumonia (Palmer <em>et al</em>., 2003;
                        Palmer <em>et al</em>., 2009; Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, 2010; Toren <em>et al</em>., 2011) and between welding and invasive pneumococcal
                        disease (Wong <em>et al</em>., 2010). PPV23 (single 0.5ml dose in those who have not received PPV previously) should be considered for those at risk of
                        frequent or continuous occupational exposure to metal fume (e.g. welders) taking into account the exposure control measures in place. Vaccination may
                        reduce the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease but should not replace the need for measures to prevent or reduce exposure.

                        There are very few individuals who cannot receive pneumococcal vaccines. When there is doubt, appropriate advice should be sought from a consultant paediatrician, immunisation co-ordinator or consultant in communicable disease control rather than withholding the vaccine. <br><br>The vaccines should not be given to those who have had:

                    <p>Confirmed anaphylaxis is rare. Other allergic conditions, such as rashes, may occur more commonly and are not contraindications to further immunisation. A careful history of the event will often distinguish between true anaphylaxis and other events that are either not due to the vaccine or not life-threatening. In the latter circumstance, it may be possible to continue the immunisation course. Specialist advice must be sought on the vaccines and the circumstances in which they could be given. The risk to the individual of not being immunised must be taken into account.</p>

                        Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation should be
                        postponed until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any signs or
                        symptoms to the adverse effects of the vaccine.

                        Pneumococcal vaccines may be given to pregnant women when the need for protection is required without delay. There is no evidence of risk from vaccinating
                        pregnant women or those who are breast-feeding with inactivated viral or bacterial vaccines or toxoids (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004).

                        It is important that premature infants have their immunisations at the appropriate chronological age, according to the schedule. The occurrence of apnoea

                        Very premature infants (born &#8804; 28 weeks of gestation) who are in hospital should have respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs when given their first
                        immunisation, particularly those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. If the child has apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations after the first
                        immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital, with respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hours (Pfister <em>et al</em>. 2004; Ohlsson <em>et al</em>. 2004; Schulzke <em>et al</em>. 2005; Pourcyrous <em>et al</em>., 2007; Klein <em>et al</em>., 2008).

                        Studies on the clinical efficacy of PPV23 in HIV-infected adults have reported inconsistent findings, including one study from the developing world where a
                        higher risk of pneumonia was observed in vaccinees (Watera <em>et al</em>., 2004). Observational studies in developed countries have not confirmed this
                        finding, and most experts believe that the potential benefit of pneumococcal vaccination outweighs the risk in developed countries (USPHS/IDSA, 2001).

                        For children with HIV infection (regardless of CD4 count), clinicians may also wish to consider the joint guidance from the Paediatric European Network for

                        Prevenar13<sup>&#174;</sup> vaccine carries a black triangle symbol (&#9660;). This is a standard symbol added to the product information of a vaccine
                        during the earlier stages of its introduction, to encourage reporting of all suspected adverse reactions. Anyone can report a suspected adverse reaction to
                        the Medical and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) using the Yellow Card reporting scheme (

                        The safety of the vaccine was assessed in controlled clinical studies and the safety profile of Prevenar13<sup>&#174;</sup> was similar to Prevenar <sup>&#174;</sup>. For Prevenar13<sup>&#174;</sup>, very common or common reactions reported included decreased appetite; pyrexia; irritability; any
                        injection-site erythema: induration/swelling or pain/ tenderness; somnolence; poor quality sleep (Wyeth, 2010). Reports of all adverse reactions can be
                        found in the summary of product characteristics for Prevenar 13<sup>&#174;</sup> (Wyeth, 2010).

                        Mild soreness and induration at the site of injection lasting one to three days and, less commonly, a low grade fever may occur. More severe systemic

                        Any case of invasive pneumococcal infection or lobar pneumonia believed to be due to <em>S. pneumoniae</em> should prompt a review of the patient's medical
                        history to establish whether they are in a recognised risk group and whether they have been appropriately immunised. Unimmunised or partially immunised at
                        risk individuals should be vaccinated upon discharge from hospital whenever possible.

                    <p>
                        Clinicians should ensure that children diagnosed with IPD have completed the recommended national immunisation schedule. Infants who are younger than 12
                        months of age at the time of IPD and who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated should complete the recommended immunisation schedule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Immunised children who subsequently develop IPD caused by one of the pneumococcal vaccine serotypes should be investigated for possible underlying immune
                        deficiency. If the child falls into one of the clinical risk groups in Table 25.1, then additional vaccinations should be offered as recommended in this
                        chapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Isolates from all cases of IPD should be referred to the national reference laboratory for serotyping. All new cases of IPD in children in aged &lt;5 years
                        England and Wales, regardless of serotype, will be followed up by Public Health England (for England and Wales) and Health Protection Scotland. Some cases
                        may require serotype-specific antibody and/or additional pneumoccocal vaccination testing depending on the pneumococcal vaccination status of the child and
                        the infecting pneumococcal serotype.

                        Close contacts of pneumococcal meningitis or other invasive pneumococcal disease are not normally at an increased risk of pneumococcal infection and
                        therefore antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated. Clusters of invasive pneumococcal disease should be discussed with local health protection teams.

                        Outbreaks of pneumococcal respiratory disease in hospitals and residential care homes need prompt investigation. Control measures including vaccination may
                        be appropriate; these should be agreed in discussion with local health protection or infection control teams. For further information see the interim UK
