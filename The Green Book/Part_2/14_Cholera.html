                        Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal illness caused by the gram-negative bacterium <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Following colonisation of the small bowel, <i>V. cholerae</i> produces an enterotoxin that causes secretion of fluid and electrolytes and leads to painless, watery diarrhoea. Cholera is characterised by the sudden onset of profuse, watery stools with occasional vomiting. In severe disease, dehydration, metabolic acidosis and circulatory collapse may follow rapidly. Untreated, over 50% of the most severe cases die within a few hours of onset; with prompt, correct treatment, mortality is less than 1%. Mild cases with only moderate diarrhoea also occur and asymptomatic infection is common. The incubation period is usually between two and five days but may be only a few hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>The disease is mainly water-borne through ingestion of faecally contaminated water or shellfish and other foods. Person-to-person spread may occur through the faecal-oral route. The risk to travellers even in infected areas is very small.</p>
                    <p>
                        Cholera serogroup O1 is classified by biotype (classical or El Tor) and is further divided into subtypes (Ogawa or Inaba). Worldwide, <i>V. cholerae</i> El Tor is currently the predominant biotype and Ogawa the predominant subtype.

                        The last indigenous case of cholera in England and Wales was reported in 1893. Occasional imported cases occur, but the risk of an outbreak is very small
                        in countries with modern sanitation and water supplies, and high standards of food hygiene. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 126 laboratory
                        notifications of cholera from 1990 through to 2001 were reported (Lawrence and Jones, 2004). Of these, 64% were imported from the Indian subcontinent. For
                        the latest epidemiological data on cholera cases reported in England and Wales please see:

                        Cholera due to the classical biotype of <em>V. cholerae</em> was endemic in the Ganges Delta of West Bengal and Bangladesh during the last two centuries
                        and caused epidemics and global pandemics. The seventh global pandemic, which started in 1961, is due to the El Tor biotype and is now widespread in Asia
                        and Africa; Central and South America were affected in the early and mid-1990s but have largely brought the disease under control. A new serogroup of <em>V. cholerae</em> (O139), which produces similar symptoms, emerged in the Bay of Bengal in the early 1990s, is present in South-East Asia and China, and
                        is responsible for about 15% of reported cholera cases in these regions (World Health Organization, 2004).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2003, 45 countries officially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) 111,575 cases of cholera and 1,894 deaths (WHO, 2004), an overall
                        case-fatality ratio (CFR) of 1.7%. In certain vulnerable groups and high-risk areas, the CFR reached as high as 41%. These reports of cases and deaths are
                        considered to grossly underestimate the actual numbers due to under-reporting and the limitations of surveillance systems. Countries in Africa
                        (particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Mozambique, Somalia and Uganda) accounted for 96% of reported cases in 2003. For the latest
                        epidemiological information from WHO on global cholera reports please see:

                        Prevention of cholera depends primarily on improving sanitation and water supplies in endemic areas and on scrupulous personal and food and water hygiene.
                        While new oral cholera vaccines can provide individual protection against <em>V. cholerae</em> O1, their role in endemic and outbreak conditions is not yet
                        defined (WHO, 2004). Since 1973, when the WHO removed cholera vaccination from the International Health Regulations, there has been no requirement for
                        cholera vaccination for travel between countries (WHO, 1983).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The only cholera vaccine licensed in the UK since May 2004 is Dukoral&reg;, a killed <em>V. cholerae</em> whole-cell (WC) vaccine with recombinant B subunit of
                        cholera toxin (rCTB), administered orally. Intramuscular cholera vaccines are no longer recommended for use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The whole-cell, B subunit vaccine (WC-rCTB, which used purified cholera toxin prior to the development of recombinant cholera toxin) has been evaluated for
                        protective efficacy in trials in Bangladesh and Peru. In the trials in Bangladesh, three doses of vaccine demonstrated 85% protective efficacy (95%
                        confidence interval 56%-94%) at six months in children aged two to 15 years and in women over the age of 15 (Clemens <em>et al</em>., 1986; Clemens <em>et al</em>., 1990).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The protective efficacy of the vaccine when given to children aged two to five years waned rapidly so that, by 36 months after administration, the
                        cumulative protective efficacy was 26%, compared with children and adults over the age of five years in whom it was 63%. From this data, adults require two
                        doses of vaccine and a reinforcing dose after two years. Young children require three doses of vaccine to establish effective immunity (Clemens <em>et al</em>., 1987) with a reinforcing dose after six months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A trial in Peru using two doses of vaccine (WC-rCTB) in young adult military recruits demonstrated 86% protective efficacy (95% confidence interval,
                        36%-97%) at about four months (S&aacute;nchez <em>et al</em>., 1994). This trial followed an earlier trial in Peru which did not reach as high a level of
                        protection (Taylor <em>et al</em>., 2000). In a challenge study with North American volunteers, three doses of WC-rCTB provided 64% protection (Black <em>et al</em>., 1987).

                        <p>
                            Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2 &#176; C to +8 &#176; C and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless they have been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause hairline cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.

                            The objective of the cholera immunisation programme is to protect those who are most at risk of serious illness or death from the disease. Cholera vaccine is indicated for active immunisation against disease caused by V. cholerae serogroup O1 in adults and child travellers from two years of age who are considered at risk for cholera. General estimates of travellers&#146;  risk of cholera based on imported cases into Europe and North America are in the order of two to three per million travellers (Mahon <i>et al</i>., 1996; Morger <i>et al.,</i> 1983; Wittlinger <i>et al.,</i> 1995; S&#225;nchez and Taylor, 1997).</p>
                            <p>Immunisation against cholera can be considered, following a full risk assessment, for the following categories of traveller (JCVI, 2004): </p>

                            <ul>

                                <li>
                                    <span>relief or disaster aid workers </span>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span>persons with remote itineraries in areas where cholera epidemics are occurring and there is limited access to medical care </span>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span>travellers to potential cholera risk areas, for whom vaccination is considered potentially beneficial. </span>.
                                </li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>No traveller should be required to demonstrate vaccination against cholera. Officials at a few remote borders may occasionally ask people travelling from infected areas for evidence of immunisation. Travellers who are likely to cross such borders, especially overland, should be advised to carry a signed statement on official paper that cholera vaccine is not required (Lea and Leese, 2001). </p>
                            <p>The vaccine is not recommended for prevention of the syndrome of travellers&#146;  diarrhoea since it only protects against the heat-labile toxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (LT-ETEC). The contribution LT-ETEC makes in travellers&#146;  diarrhoea is variable and usually small. It is only one of the many bacteria, viruses and protozoa that cause this syndrome</p>

                            <div id="thirdtitle">Individuals at occupational risk</div>

                            <p>Vaccine is recommended for laboratory workers who may be regularly exposed to cholera in the course of their work. This would normally only include those working in reference laboratories or in laboratories attached to infectious disease units. </p>

                            <div id="thirdtitle">Primary Immunisation</div>

                            <p>The primary course of the immunisation must be restarted if more than six weeks have elapsed between the first and second doses or if more than two years have elapsed since the last vaccination. These recommendations are unique to this vaccine.</p>

If the risk of cholera is high then the vaccine should be considered in these circumstances.<

Serious adverse events, including a flu-like syndrome, rash, arthralgia and paraesthesiae are rare, occurring in fewer than one per 10,000 doses distributed (Summary of Product Characteristics, 2004). </p>
