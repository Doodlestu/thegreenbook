                        Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne viral encephalitis caused by a flavivirus. It is the leading cause of childhood encephalitis in Asia, with 20,000 to 50,000 cases per annum (Halstead <i>et al</i>., 2008; World Health Organization, 1998).
                    </p>
                    <p>It is endemic in rural areas, especially where rice growing and pig farming coexist, and epidemics occur in rural and occasionally in urban areas. Highest transmission rates occur during and just after wet seasons, when mosquitoes are most active, but seasonal patterns vary both within individual countries and from year to year. This disease is not transmitted from person to person.</p>
                    <p>
                        The incubation period is from five to 15 days. Illness ranges from asymptomatic infection (about one in 250 infections is estimated to become clinically apparent) to severe encephalitis with a high mortality and a high rate of permanent neurological sequelae (approximately 30%) in survivors (Halstead <i>et al</i>., 2008).
                    </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>
                    <p>Outbreaks were recorded in Japan as early as 1871; the first major epidemic in Japan was described in 1924 and involved 6000 cases. JE spread throughout Asia but national immunisation campaigns and urban development in the 1960s led to the near-elimination of JE in Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. However, JE remains endemic in much of the rest of Asia. The virus was isolated in the 1930s, and the first inactivated mouse-brain derived vaccines were produced in the same decade.</p>

                <p>There is currently one licensed vaccine recommended for use in the UK - IXIARO&reg. IXIARO&reg is licensed in the UK for individuals aged two months and older.</p>
                <p>IXIARO&reg is an inactivated vaccine produced in Vero cells and adsorbed onto an adjuvant of aluminium hydroxide to improve its immunogenicity. </p>
                <p>IXIARO&reg does not contain thiomersal.</p>
                <p>The vaccine is inactivated and does not contain live organisms so cannot cause the disease against which it protects. </p>
                <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>
                <p>Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&degC to +8&degC and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless they have been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause hairline cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.</p>
                <div id="thirdtitle">Presentation</div>
                <p>IXIARO&reg is available as a 0.5ml suspension in a pre-filled syringe (Type 1 glass) with a plunger stopper (chlorobutyl elastomer). </p>

                <p>IXIARO&reg should be given by intramuscular injection. However, for individuals who have a bleeding disorder, IXIARO&reg should be given by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.</p>
                <p>IXIARO&reg can be given at the same time as other travel or routine vaccines. The vaccines should be given at a separate site, preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003).</p>
                <div id="thirdtitle">Disposal</div>
                <p>Equipment used for vaccination, including used vials, ampoules, or partially discharged vaccines should be disposed of at the end of a session by sealing in a proper, puncture-resistant'sharps'; box according to local authority regulations and guidance in the technical memorandum 07-01 (Department of Health, 2006).</p>

                    <p>The objective of JE vaccination is to protect individuals at high risk of exposure during travel or in the course of their occupation. Guidance on the employer&#146;s responsibility under Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations is described in Chapter 12.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Primary immunisation</div>
                    <p>Two JE vaccines are available in the UK, IXIARO&reg and Green Cross. Only IXIARO&reg is licensed and recommended for the following age groups. It is not known whether the two vaccines are interchangeable during a course of vaccination, although IXIARO&reg may be used as a booster for those that received Green Cross vaccine previously.</p>
                    <div id="fourthtitle">Infants under two months of age</div>
                    <p>There are no safety or efficacy data on the use of IXIARO&reg in children under two months of age. IXIARO&reg  is not usually recommended in children under two months of age in the UK.</p>
                    <div id="fourthtitle">Children aged two months to under 36 months of age</div>
                    <p>The recommended vaccine schedule is two doses of IXIARO&reg: 0.25 ml on days 0 and 28. Full immunity takes up to one week to develop after the second dose.</p>
                    <p>Green Cross vaccine is no longer recommended for immunization against Japanese encephalitis in the UK as a licensed vaccine (IXIARO&reg) is available.</p>
                    <div id="fourthtitle">Children aged three years and over and adults</div>
                    <p>The recommended vaccine schedule is two doses of IXIARO&reg: 0.5ml on days 0 and 28. Full immunity takes up to one week to develop after the second dose.</p>
                    <p>Green Cross vaccine is not recommended in this age group as a licensed vaccine (IXIARO&reg) is available. </p>
                    <p>Under exceptional circumstances, when time constraints preclude giving the second dose of IXIARO&reg  at 28 days and based on a risk assessment, IXIARO&reg can be given up to four days earlier, although this is not a licensed use. There are insufficient data to support a recommendation for any further acceleration of the schedule. </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Reinforcing immunisation</div>
                    <p>Adults at continuous risk of acquiring JE, e.g. laboratory personnel and long-term travellers who expect to reside in JE endemic areas for appreciable periods of time, should receive a booster dose at 12-24 months after primary immunisation. Adults who have had a previous course of any Japanese encephalitis vaccine can receive a single dose of IXIARO&reg as a booster. There are no data to permit recommendations for boosting in infants and children below 18 years or for longer term boosting in adults. However, should sustained protection be needed in infants or children a booster may need to be considered. Recommendations will be made by the JCVI relating to any further boosters needed for IXIARO&reg as soon as the necessary data becomes available. </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Travellers and those going to reside abroad</div>
                    <p>All travellers should undergo a careful risk assessment that takes into consideration their itinerary, season of travel, duration of stay and planned activities. The risk of JE should then be balanced against the risk of adverse events from vaccination. JE vaccine is recommended for those who are going to reside in an area where JE is endemic or epidemic. </p>
                    <p>There is geographical variation in transmission periods -from all year round to seasonal. In temperate regions of Asia, transmission is generally from May to September. It extends from March through to October in areas further south, and can be year round in tropical areas. Travellers to South and South-East Asia and the Far East should be immunised if staying for a month or longer in endemic areas during the transmission season, especially if travel will include rural areas. Other travellers with shorter exposure periods should be immunised if the risk is considered sufficient. For example, those spending a short period of time in rice fields (where the mosquito vector breeds) or close to pig farming (a reservoir host for the virus) should be considered for vaccination.</p>
                    <p>Country-specific recommendations and information on the global epidemiology of JE can be found in the following websites <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.nathnac.org', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">www.nathnac.org</a> and <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.travax.nhs.uk', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">www.travax.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

                    <p>
                        Immunisation is recommended for all research laboratory staff who have potential exposure to the virus. Worldwide there have been more than 20 cases of laboratory-acquired JE virus infection (Halstead <i>et al</i>., 2008).
