                <p>
                    Meningococcal disease occurs as a result of a systemic bacterial infection by <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>.
                </p>
                <p>Meningococci are gram-negative diplococci, divided into antigenically distinct capsular groups. They are classified according to characteristics of the polysaccharide capsule into capsular group, and of outer membrane proteins into type and subtype. Further characterisation, undertaken by sequencing several other regions of the chromosomal DNA, defines the sequence type (ST). </p>
                <p>There are to date 12 identified capsular groups, A, B, C, E, H, I, K, L, W, X, Y, and Z, of which groups B, C, W and Y were historically the most common in the UK. However, since the introduction of the routine meningococcal C conjugate vaccination programme, cases of invasive meningococcal disease in the UK due to capsular group C have reduced dramatically, with capsular group B now accounting for over 80% of cases.</p>
                <p>Meningococci colonise the nasopharynx of humans and are frequently harmless commensals. Between 5 and 11% of adults and up to 25% of adolescents carry the bacteria without any signs or symptoms of the disease. In infants and young children, the carriage rate is low (Christensen <i>et al</i>., 2010). It is not fully understood why disease develops in some individuals but not in others. Age, season, smoking, preceding influenza A infection and living in 'closed' or 'semi-closed' communities, such as university halls of residence or military barracks, have been identified as risk factors (Cartwright, 1995).</p>
                <p>Transmission is by aerosol, droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions of someone carrying the organism. Transmission usually requires either frequent or prolonged close contact. There is a marked seasonal variation in meningococcal disease, with peak levels in the winter months declining to low levels by late summer.</p>
               
                <!--<img src="Images/Figure 22.1.png" width="100%">
                Figure 22.1 The 'glass' test (picture courtesy of Meningitis Research Foundation)-->
                
                <p>Meningococcal infection most commonly presents as either meningitis or
                septicaemia, or a combination of both. Less commonly, individuals may
                present with pneumonia, myocarditis, endocarditis, pericarditis, arthritis,
                conjunctivitis, urethritis, pharyngitis and cervicitis (Rosenstein <i>et al</i>., 2001).</p>
                
                <p>The incubation period is from two to seven days and the onset of disease varies
                from fulminant with acute and overwhelming features, to insidious with mild
                prodromal symptoms. Early symptoms and signs are usually malaise, pyrexia
                and vomiting. Headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, drowsiness or confusion
                and joint pains may variably occur. In meningococcal septicaemia, a rash may
                develop, along with signs of advancing shock and isolated limb and/or joint pain.
                The rash may be non-specific early on but as the disease progresses the rash may
                become petechial or purpuric and may not blanch. This can readily be confirmed
                by gentle pressure with a glass (the 'glass test') when the rash can be seen to
                persist. In young infants particularly, the onset may be insidious and
                the signs may be non-specific without 'classical' features of meningitis.
                    
                    <p>Health professionals should be alert to the possibility of meningococcal
                    infection in a young child presenting with vomiting, pyrexia and irritability
                    and, if still patent, raised anterior fontanelle tension. Clinical deterioration may be very rapid with poor peripheral perfusion, pallor, tachypnoea, tachycardia
                    and the emergence of the meningococcal rash. In severe cases, patients may
                    present with hypotension or in coma.</p>
                    
                <p>The incidence of meningococcal disease is highest in children under five years
                of age, with a peak incidence in those under one year of age. There is a
                secondary peak in incidence in young people aged 15 to 19 years of age.</p>
                
                    <p>The average annual incidence of invasive meningococcal disease across all age
                    groups is currently 2 per 100,000 (Ladhani <i>et al</i>., 2012). Overall, the case-fatality
                    ratio in the UK fell from an historic average of 10% to 5% by 2011 following the
                    routine conjugate vaccination against capsular group C disease (Ramsay <i>et al</i>.,
                    1997; Goldacre <i>et al</i>., 2003; Ladhani <i>et al</i>., 2012). The case-fatality ratio is higher
                    in individuals with septicaemia than in those with meningitis alone (Stanton et
                    al., 2011), increases with age, and is higher in individuals with capsular group C
                    than capsular group B disease (Ramsay <i>et al</i>., 1997). Some strains of Neisseria
                    meningitidis appear to be associated with higher case fatality ratios, even after
                    controlling for age (Trotter <i>et al</i>., 2002; Goldacre <i>et al</i>., 2003). Studies in
                    paediatric intensive care settings have indicated that prompt and active
                    management may reduce fatality (Thorburn <i>et al</i>., 2001; Booy <i>et al</i>., 2001). In
                    those who survive capsular group B infection, up to 36% may develop long-term
                    deficits in physical, cognitive, and psychological functioning, including 9% with
                    major disabling deficits (Viner <i>et al</i>., 2012). The most severe long-term
                    complications include hearing loss, severe visual impairment, communication
                    problems, limb amputation(s), seizures and brain damage.</p>

                <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>

                <p>
                    In the UK, large epidemics of meningococcal disease, probably caused by 
                    capsular group A infections, coincided with each of the two world wars (Jones, 
                    1995). After the Second World War, disease levels declined from a maximum 
                    of over 12,000 notifications of meningococcal disease in England and Wales 
                    per year. However, between 1972 and 1975, incidence increased temporarily, 
                    associated with a capsular group B serotype 2a strain. In 1985, another 
                    hyperendemic period began, associated with increased circulation of a 
                    hypervirulent ST32, B15:P1.16 strain. A further hyperendemic period started 
                    in 1995â€“96, associated with an increased proportion of disease due to ST11 
                    capsular group C serotype 2a infection. There was a shift in age distribution 
                    towards teenagers and young adults, among whom case fatality rates are 
                    particularly high. This period ended with the introduction of MenC vaccination 
                    in the UK from November 1999.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meningococcal disease occurs in all countries. In the 'meningitis belt' of sub-Saharan Africa, the incidence of meningococcal infection rises sharply
                    towards the end of the dry, dusty season when disease spreads rapidly, resulting in large epidemics within very short periods. These are predominantly due
                    to serogroup A, but recent outbreaks have included serogroups W and X. Increasing numbers of countries in sub-Saharan Africa have already
                    introduced Group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine into routine and
                    catch-up vaccination campaigns.
                </p>

            
                <p>Large epidemics of meningococcal disease have been linked to the annual Hajj
                pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, resulting in importations into a number
                of countries, including the UK. These were initially caused by capsular group
                A infection and immunisation against group A became a requirement for entry
                to Saudi Arabia. In 2000 and 2001, an increase in capsular group W infections
                followed the Hajj with a number of cases in UK pilgrims and their families
                (Hahne <i>et al</i>., 2002). Evidence of receipt of quadrivalent vaccine (capsular
                groups A, C, Y, W) became an entry requirement in 2002.</p>
                
                <div id="thirdtitle">The development of conjugate meningococcal vaccines</div>
                    
                 <p>Meningococcal vaccines based solely on the capsular group C polysaccharide
                (often called 'plain' polysaccharide vaccines) provide only short-term protection
                to older children and adults and do not protect infants. In the mid-1990s,
                therefore meningococcal C (MenC) conjugate vaccines were developed to
                provide longer-term protection and to be effective in infants. As the rate of
                meningococcal capsular group C infections continued to rise, the development
                of the new vaccines was accelerated.</p>
                    
                <p>In November 1999, MenC conjugate vaccine was introduced into the UK
                routine immunisation programme along with a catch-up campaign for older
                children, adolescents and young adults up to 18 years. In January 2002, the
                campaign was extended to include adults under 25 years of age.</p>
                    
                <p>Following the MenC vaccine campaign, the number of reported and laboratoryconfirmed
                capsular group C cases fell by over 90% in all age groups immunised
                (Figures 22.2 and 22.3) (Campbell <i>et al</i>., 2010; Miller <i>et al</i>., 2001; Trotter <i>et al</i>.,
                2004). Cases in other age groups fell by approximately two-thirds as a result of
                reduced carriage rates (Maiden <i>et al</i>., 2002) and reduced risk of exposure
                (Trotter <i>et al</i>., 2003). This indirect (herd) protection contributed to the number
                of cases continuing to fall across all age groups and now remaining at very low
                levels.</p>

                    <p>In 2006, following studies that showed that protection against meningococcal
                    capsular group C waned during the second year of life (Trotter <i>et al</i>., 2004), a
                    booster dose (combined with Hib vaccine as Hib/MenC vaccine) was introduced
                    at 12 months of age.</p>
                    
                <p>In 2013, despite continuing excellent disease control, increasing evidence
                showed that vaccination against meningococcal capsular group C disease in
                early childhood provides short-term protective immune responses (Borrow et
                al., 2010; Kitchin <i>et al</i>., 2009; Perret <i>et al</i>., 2010), that vaccination later in
                childhood provides higher levels of antibodies that persist for longer (Snape et
                al., 2008a), and that meningococcal capsular group C vaccination significantly
                reduces nasopharyngeal carriage of capsular group C meningococcus leading
                to indirect or herd protection (Ramsay <i>et al</i>., 2003; Maiden <i>et al</i>., 2008). This
                evidence led the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to
                consider a further amendment to the schedule to sustain long term control by
                ensuring high antibody levels are maintained in the age groups at which
                meningococcal carriage becomes more common. An adolescent booster dose at
                age 13-14 years was added to the schedule.</p>
                    
                <p>At the same time, JCVI considered a study that showed a single dose of some
                varieties of MenC vaccines at three months of age would be sufficient to prime
                infants against meningococcal capsular group C disease, and provide protection
                for the first year of life (Findlow <i>et al</i>., 2012). Therefore the second dose at 4
                months of age was removed from the routine schedule in 2013.</p>
                    
                <p>Overall levels of invasive meningococcal disease have decreased since Men C
                vaccine was introduced with capsular group B strains now accounting for over
                80% of laboratory-confirmed cases submitted to the Public Health England
                (PHE) Meningococcal Reference Unit and the Scottish Haemophilus, Legionella,
                Meningococcus and Pneumococcus Reference Laboratory (SHLMPRL).</p>

                 <p>In January 2013, a meningococcal B (MenB) multicomponent protein vaccine
                was authorised for use by the European Medicines Agency. In a European phase
                III trial of 1885 infants, MenB was shown to be immunogenic and produced
                minimal interference with the response to routine vaccines when given at the
                same time (Gossger et al., 2012). The vaccine may provide protection against
                infection caused by up to 88% of meningococcal group B strains in England and
                Wales (Frosi et al., 2013).</p>

                   The MenC conjugate vaccines are made from capsular polysaccharide that
                has been extracted from cultures of capsular group C Neisseria meningitidis.
                The polysaccharide is linked (conjugated) to a carrier protein, according to the
                manufacturer's method. In the UK, MenC vaccines have been used that have
                been conjugated with either CRM197 (a non-toxic variant of diphtheria toxin)
                or tetanus toxoid. The conjugation increases the immunogenicity, especially
                in young children in whom the plain polysaccharide vaccines are less
                immunogenic. MenC vaccine confers no protection against other
                meningococcal capsular groups.

                    The Hib/MenC conjugate vaccine is made from capsular polysaccharides of
                    <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b and <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> capsular group C,
                    which are both conjugated to tetanus toxoid. The vaccine has been shown to
                    elicit booster responses to both Hib and MenC when given in the second year
                    of life to children who were primed in infancy with Hib and MenC conjugate
                    vaccines.

                <p>
                    The MenACWY conjugate vaccines are made from capsular polysaccharides
                    that have been extracted from cultures of capsular group A, C, W and Y
                    Neisseria meningitidis. The polysaccharides are conjugated to a carrier protein.
                    In the UK, MenACWY vaccines are conjugated with either CRM197 or tetanus
                    toxoid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although neither of the available vaccines is licensed for use in infants, data
                    show a good antibody response to all capsular groups after two doses of
                    Menveo<sup>&reg</sup>  conjugate vaccine (Snape <i>et al</i>., 2008b; Perrett <i>et al</i>., 2009). The
                    responses are better than seen with the polysaccharide vaccine (Borrow, 2009)
                    and the response to capsular group C is comparable with that seen with the
                    monovalent MenC conjugate vaccine (Southern <i>et al</i>., 2009). Based on this and
                    the experience with other conjugate vaccines, immunity is expected to be
                    higher, longer-lasting and confer less risk of immunological tolerance than with
                    the polysaccharide vaccine. For this reason, both conjugate vaccines are
                    recommended in preference to polysaccharide vaccine, particularly in children
                    from one to under five years of age, where indicated. MenveoÂ® is recommended
                    for use in children below one year of age as there are some data on the use of
                    MenveoÂ® in that age group.

                <p>
                    The (non-conjugated) polysaccharide vaccine is made from the polysaccharide
                    in the capsules of capsular groups A, C, W and Y Neisseria meningitidis
                    organisms. Young infants make some response to capsular group A, Y and W
                    polysaccharides from three months of age (Peltola <i>et al</i>., 1985; Cadoz <i>et al</i>.,
                    1985; Al-Mazrou <i>et al</i>., 2005). However, protection is not long-lasting as
                    immunological memory is not induced. Vaccine-induced immunity lasts
                    approximately three to five years in older children and adults; in younger
                    children, a more rapid decline in antibody has been noted (Frasch, 1995). In
                    addition, polysaccharide vaccine may induce immune hyporesponsiveness
                    when immune responses to second and subsequent doses of the same vaccine are attenuated (Jokhdar et al., 2004; Khalil et al., 2005). The response is
                    strictly capsular group-specific and confers no protection against capsular
                    group B organisms.

                 <div id="fourthtitle">MenB protein vaccine (4CMenB, Bexsero<sup>&reg</sup> , Novartis)</div>
               
                <p>The multicomponent 4CMenB protein vaccine (Bexsero<sup>&reg</sup> ) is made from
                three Neisseria meningitidis proteins produced by recombinant DNA
                technology (Neisseria heparin binding antigen (NHBA), Neisserial adhesion
                A (NadA), factor H binding protein (fHbp) and a preparation of Neisseria
                meningitidis capsular group B outer membrane vesicles (OMV). The 4CMenB
                vaccine is immunogenic in young infants (Findlow <i>et al</i>., 2010) and
                adolescents (Santolaya <i>et al</i>., 2012) and is licensed for use from two months
                of age. Laboratory-based studies suggest that Bexsero<sup>&reg</sup>  may protect against
                up to 88% of circulating MenB strains in England and Wales (Frosi <i>et al</i>.,
                2013), but its effectiveness in preventing disease in a population has yet to be
                established. Bexsero<sup>&reg</sup>  may also protect against infection by capsular groups
                other than group B.</p>
               
                <p>Although Bexsero<sup>&reg</sup>  is licensed and has been available for use in the UK since
                December 2013, it is not part of the routine immunisation schedule and its use
                is currently restricted to certain groups at high risk of developing invasive
                meningococcal disease (see 'Children and adults with asplenia, splenic
                dysfunction or complement disorders'), laboratory workers working with
                meningococci and in the management of outbreaks of meningococcal disease
                (see 'Management of suspected cases and contacts').</p>
						
                <p>All licensed meningococcal vaccines are inactivated, do not contain live
                organisms and, therefore, cannot cause the diseases against which they
                protect.</p>
                
                <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>

                <p>Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&deg;C to +8&deg;C and
                protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat and
                cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing
                their shelf life. Effectiveness of vaccines may be impaired if not stored at the
                correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of
                potency for some vaccines. It can also cause hairline cracks in the container,
                leading to contamination of the contents. For further information on storage
                see Chapter 3.</p>

                <p>
                    All meningococcal-containing vaccines are given intramuscularly into the upper arm or anterolateral thigh. This is to reduce the risk of localised
                    reactions, which are more common when the vaccine is given subcutaneously (Mark <em>et al</em>., 1999; Zuckerman, 2000; Diggle <em>et al</em>., 2000).
                    However, for individuals with a bleeding disorder, vaccines should be given by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding. When administering
                    MenB vaccine, it is important to note the information on fever and the
                    administration of paracetamol (see 'Adverse reactions' section below).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meningococcal vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus,
                    pertussis, polio and Hib. The vaccines should be given at a separate site, preferably in a separate limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given
                    at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). The site at which each vaccine is given should be noted in the child's clinical record.

                <p>Equipment used for vaccination, including used vials, ampoules or syringes,

                &#8225;Although the summary of product characteristics for available MenC conjugate vaccines states that two

                study shows that immunogenicity is adequate following a primary course of a single dose in infants
                (Findlow <i>et al</i>., 2012).
                <br><br>
                *If no doses of MenC vaccine have been received follow the 'Meningococcal C vaccination schedule for
				individuals with unknown or incomplete vaccination histories' table (Table 22.3)

                <p>Meningitec<sup>&reg</sup>  vaccine does not provide adequate protection against
                meningococcal capsular group C disease when administered as single dose in
                infancy, and is therefore no longer recommended for use in those less than 12
                months of age. Should an infant have received a single dose of Meningitec<sup>&reg</sup> 
                at 3 months of age (for example inadvertently or overseas) the priority must
                be to ensure that they receive the 12-month Menitorix<sup>&reg</sup>  booster and, where
                possible, ensure that this dose is not delayed. If a second dose of MenC
                vaccine is given at 4 months then only Meningitec<sup>&reg</sup>  or Menjugate<sup>&reg</sup> , which
                are both conjugated to the CRM carrier, should be used. NeisVac-C<sup>&reg</sup>  should
                not be used for this purpose because an unpublished PHE trial found that
                infants receiving Meningitec<sup>&reg</sup>  at 3 months and NeisVac-C<sup>&reg</sup>  at 4 months had
                poor antibody responses against both MenC and Hib. The immunological
                basis for this finding of poor response is uncertain.</p>

                <p>
                    When a child born in the UK presents with an inadequate immunisation history, every effort should be made to clarify what immunisations they may have had
                    (see Chapter 11). Children coming to the UK who have a history of immunisation in their country of origin may not have been offered protection with all the
                    antigens currently used in the UK, and they may not have received MenC-containing vaccines.

                <p>Children coming from developing countries, from areas of conflict, or from hard-to-reach population groups may not have been fully immunised. Where there is no reliable history of previous immunisation, it should be assumed that they are unimmunised and the full UK recommendations should be followed (see Chapter 11).

                <p>Children over the age of one and under the age of ten years who have not
                received any MenC vaccine should be offered a single dose of MenC or Hib/
                MenC (if they are also unvaccinated for Hib). The response at this age is very
                good even where no infant doses have been received. These children should
                still receive the teenage booster when they reach the target age.</p>
                    
                    <p>Children who reach the target age for the teenage booster who were vaccinated
                    according to the previous vaccine schedules (with or without a toddler
                    booster) should be offered a single dose. Children above the age of ten years
                    who have not received any MenC may receive the teenage booster early (See
                    Table 22.3).</p>

                <p>Students attending university for the first time and who have never received a
                MenC vaccine, irrespective of age, should be immunised before they enrol or
                as soon as possible thereafter. For a limited period, until cohorts eligible for
                the teenage booster reach student age, first year university students should
                also receive a single dose of MenC vaccine. There is good evidence that older
                students (born before 01 September 1995) and immunised in the catch-up
                programme in 1999-2000 have retained high protective MenC antibody levels
                (Ishola <i>et al</i>., 2012).</p>

                    Children and adults with asplenia or splenic dysfunction may be at increased risk of invasive meningococcal infection. Such individuals, irrespective of
                    age or interval from splenectomy, may have a sub-optimal response to the vaccine (Balmer <em>et al</em>., 2004). Children and adults with complement
                    deficiency (Figueroa <em>et al</em>., 1991), or on Eculizumab therapy, may be at increased risk of invasive meningococcal infection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the increased risk, additional vaccinations against meningococcal disease are advised for individuals with asplenia or splenic dysfunction or when
                    complement deficiency is diagnosed depending on age and vaccination history.

                 <p>A practical schedule for immunising individuals at increased risk of meningococcal
                disease is summarised in Chapter 7, depending on the age at which their at-risk
                condition is diagnosed. These at-risk individuals may require additional doses of
                meningococcal vaccines (MenC, Men ACWY and MenB).</p>
                 
                 <p>Where an opportunity arises, and depending on the individual patient's
                circumstances, MenACWY conjugate vaccination could be considered for those
                who have only received the MenC conjugate vaccine previously.</p>

                <p>All travellers should undergo a careful risk assessment that takes into account
                their itinerary, duration of stay and planned activities. In some areas of the
                world, the risk of acquiring meningococcal infection, particularly of developing
                capsular group A disease, is much higher than in the UK. Individuals who are
                particularly at risk are visitors who live or travel 'rough', such as backpackers,
                and those living or working with local people. Large epidemics of both capsular group A and W meningococcal infection have occurred in association
                with Hajj pilgrimages, and proof of vaccination against A, C, W and Y
                capsular groups is now a visa entry requirement for pilgrims and seasonal
                workers travelling to Saudi Arabia.</p>
                            
                <p>Epidemics, mainly of capsular group A and more recently capsular group W
                infections, occur unpredictably throughout tropical Africa but particularly in
                the savannah during the dry season (December to June). Immunisation is
                recommended for long-stay or high-risk visitors to sub-Saharan Africa, for
                example, those who will be living or working closely with local people, or
                those who are backpacking.</p>
                
                 <p>
                    From time to time, outbreaks of meningococcal infection may be reported from other parts of the world, including the Indian sub-continent and other parts
                    of Asia:

                <p>Where such outbreaks are shown to be due to vaccine-preventable capsular

                <p>In at-risk individuals, those who have never received MenACWY conjugate
                vaccine after one year of age should be given a dose of MenACWY conjugate
                vaccine if they are travelling to an area that puts them at risk from
                meningococcal infection. The MenACWY conjugate vaccine is likely to
                provide better protection than the polysaccharide vaccine.</p>

                    Both polysaccharide ACWY (ACWY Vax) and conjugate ACWY vaccines are available. In children under five years old, it is recommended that ACWY conjugate
                    vaccine be used in preference to ACWY Vax because of the better immune response and to reduce the risk of hyporesponsiveness (Jokhdar <em>et al</em>.,
                    2004; Khalil <em>et al</em>., 2005). In children aged over five years and adults, ACWY conjugate vaccine should be used in preference to the polysaccharide
                    vaccine to reduce the risk of hyporesponsiveness and to provide better protection. - see <i>Table 22.4 below.</i>

                            <p>There are very few individuals who cannot receive meningococcal vaccines. When there is doubt, appropriate advice should be sought from a consultant paediatrician, immunisation co-ordinator or consultant in communicable disease control, rather than withhold immunisation. The vaccines should not be given to those who have had: </p>

                                 <p> Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be
                                    postponed until they have recovered fully. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any signs or
                                    symptoms to the adverse effects of the vaccine.</p>

                                    Meningococcal vaccines may be given to pregnant women when clinically indicated. There is no evidence of risk from vaccinating pregnant women or those who

                                <p> It is important that premature infants have their immunisations at the appropriate chronological age, according to the schedule. The occurrence of apnoea

                                Very premature infants (born &#8804;28 weeks of gestation) who are in hospital should have respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs when given their first

                                immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital, with respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs (Ohlsson <em>et al</em>., 2004; Pfister <em>et al</em>., 2004; Schulzke <em>et al</em>., 2005; Pourcyrous <em>et al</em>., 2007; Klein <em>et al</em>., 2008).

                                    As the benefit of immunisation is high in this group of infants, immunisation should not be withheld or delayed.

                						<p>In infants and children under two years of age, fever â‰¥38Â°C (occasionally
                                        &#62;40&degC) was more common when Bexsero<sup>&reg</sup>  was administered at the same time
                                        as routine vaccines (see Chapter 11) than when Bexsero<sup>&reg</sup>  was given alone.
                                        Prophylactic paracetamol around the time of vaccination is not routinely
                                        recommended for preventing post-vaccination fever (see Chapter 8) because of
                                        concerns that it may lower antibody responses to some vaccines (Prymula <i>et al</i>.,
                                        2009). Where such vaccines are co-administered with Bexsero<sup>&reg</sup> , however,
                                        giving paracetamol at the time of vaccination reduces the fever associated with
                                        vaccination but does not affect the immunogenicity of either Bexsero<sup>&reg</sup>  or of
                                        routine vaccines (Prymula <i>et al</i>., 2011). Paracetamol should, therefore, be
                                        offered prophylactically when Bexsero<sup>&reg</sup>  is given with the routine vaccines in
                                        infants under one year of age. Liquid paracetamol should be given orally at a
                                        dose of 10-15 mg/kg before or at the time of vaccination. Doses can be repeated
                                        every 4-6 hours after vaccination, if needed.</p>

                                    Current recommendations from NICE are that children and young people with suspected bacterial meningitis without non-blanching rash should be transferred
                                    directly to secondary care without giving parenteral antibiotics. If urgent transfer to hospital is not possible (for example, in remote locations or
                                    because of adverse weather conditions), antibiotics should be administered to children and young people with suspected bacterial meningitis.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For suspected meningococcal disease (meningitis with non-blanching rash or meningococcal septicaemia) parenteral antibiotics (intramuscular or intravenous
                                    benzylpenicillin) should be given at the earliest opportunity, either in primary or secondary care, but urgent transfer to hospital should not be delayed
                                    in order to give the parenteral antibiotics.

                                    For public health management of contacts of cases and outbreaks, advice must be sought from the local health protection unit. Household contacts of cases
                                    of meningococcal infection are at increased risk of developing the disease. This risk is highest in the first seven days following onset in the index case
                                    but persists for at least four weeks. Immediate risk can be reduced by the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis to the whole contact group.

                                <p>
                                    For prophylaxis, the use of single dose ciprofloxacin is now recommended in preference to rifampicin, particularly because it is a single dose and is
                                    readily available in high street pharmacies. Ciprofloxacin as a single dose of 500mg may be given for adults (250mg for children aged five to 12 years and
                                    125mg for those aged one month to four years). Alternative options are discussed at

                                    For confirmed serogroup C infection, MenC conjugate vaccination should be offered to all close contacts previously unimmunised with MenC conjugate
                                    vaccination. Close contacts who are partially immunised should complete a course of MenC vaccination. Close contacts of any age who were only immunised in
                                    infancy and those who completed the recommended immunisation course (including the 12-month booster) more than one year before should be offered an extra
                                    dose of MenC conjugate vaccine.

                                    MenC conjugate vaccine should also be offered according to the recommended national schedule to any unimmunised index cases under the age of 25 years
                                    (whatever the serogroup). Although recurrent serogroup C disease is rare, this policy ensures that persons in this age group are given equivalent
                                    protection to their age-matched immunised peers.
