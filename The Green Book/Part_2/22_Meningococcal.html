                        Meningococcal disease occurs as a result of a systemic bacterial infection by <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meningococci are gram-negative diplococci, divided into antigenically distinct serogroups. They are classified according to characteristics of the
                        polysaccharide capsule into capsular group, and of outer membrane proteins into type and subtype. Further characterisation, undertaken by sequencing
                        several other regions of the chromosomal DNA, defines the sequence type (ST).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are to date 12 identified capsular groups, A, B, C, E, H, I, K, L, W, X, Y, and Z, of which groups B, C, W and Y were historically the most common in
                        the UK. However, since the introduction of the routine meningococcal C conjugate vaccination programme, cases of invasive meningococcal disease in the UK
                        from serogroup C have reduced dramatically, with serogroup B now accounting for the vast majority of cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meningococci colonise the nasopharynx of humans and are frequently harmless commensals. Between 5 and 11% of adults and up to 25% of adolescents carry the
                        bacteria without any signs or symptoms of the disease. In infants and young children, the carriage rate is low (Christensen <em>et al</em>., 2010). It is
                        not fully understood why disease develops in some individuals but not in others. Age, season, smoking, preceding influenza A infection and living in
                        'closed' or 'semi-closed' communities, such as university halls of residence or military barracks, have been identified as risk factors (Cartwright, 1995).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transmission is by aerosol, droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions of someone carrying the organism. Transmission usually requires either
                        frequent or prolonged close contact. There is a marked seasonal variation in meningococcal disease, with peak levels in the winter months declining to low
                        levels by late summer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Meningococcal infection most commonly presents as either meningitis or septicaemia, or a combination of both. Less commonly, individuals may present with
                        pneumonia, myocarditis, endocarditis, pericarditis, arthritis, conjunctivitis, urethritis, pharyngitis and cervicitis (Rosenstein <em>et al</em>., 2001).
                    </p>
                    <p>The incubation period is from two to seven days and the onset of disease varies from fulminant with acute and overwhelming features, to insidious with mild
                        prodromal symptoms. Early symptoms and signs are usually malaise, pyrexia and vomiting. Headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, drowsiness or confusion and
                        joint pains may occur variably. In meningococcal septicaemia, a rash may develop, along with signs of advancing shock and isolated limb and/or joint pain.
                        The rash may be non-specific early on but as the disease progresses the rash may become petechial or purpuric and may not blanch. This can readily be
                        confirmed by gentle pressure with a glass (the 'glass test') when the rash can be seen to persist (Figure 22.1). In young infants particularly, the onset
                        may be insidious and the signs may be non-specific without 'classical' features of meningitis. </p>
                    <p>
                        Health professionals should be alert to the possibility of meningococcal infection in a young child presenting with vomiting, pyrexia and irritability and,
                        if still patent, raised anterior fontanelle tension. Clinical deterioration may be very rapid with poor peripheral perfusion, pallor, tachypnoea,
                        tachycardia and the emergence of the meningococcal rash. In severe cases, patients may present with hypotension or in coma.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The incidence of meningococcal disease is highest in children under five years of age, with a peak incidence in those under one year of age. There is a
                        secondary peak in incidence in young people aged 15 to 19 years of age.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The average annual incidence of invasive meningococcal disease across all age groups is 2 per 100,000 (Ladhani <em>et al</em>., 2012) Overall case-fatality
                        ratio in the UK fell from an historic average of 10% to reach 5% by 2011 (Ramsay <em>et al</em>., 1997; Goldacre <em>et al</em>., 2003; Ladhani <em>et al</em>., 2012). Case-fatality ratio is higher in cases with septicaemia than in those with meningitis alone (Stanton <em>et al</em>., 2011),
                        increases with age, and are higher in individuals with serogroup C than serogroup B infections (Ramsay <em>et al</em>., 1997). Some specific strains of<em>N. meningitidis</em> appear to be associated with higher case fatality ratios, even after controlling for age (Trotter <em>et al</em>., 2002; Goldacre<em>et al</em>., 2003). Studies in paediatric intensive care settings have indicated that prompt and active management may reduce fatality ratios (Thorburn <em>et al</em>., 2001; Booy <em>et al</em>., 2001). In those who survive, approximately 25% may experience a reduced quality of life, with 10-20%
                        developing permanent sequelae (Erickson <em>et al</em>., 1998; Granoff <em>et al</em>., 2008). The most common long-term effects are skin scars, limb
                        amputation(s), hearing loss, seizures and brain damage (Steven <em>et al</em>., 1995; Granoff <em>et al</em>., 2008).
                    </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>

                    <p>
                        In the UK, large epidemics of meningococcal disease, probably caused by serogroup A infections, coincided with each of the two world wars (Figure 22.2)
                        (Jones, 1995). After the Second World War, incidence declined. However, between 1972 and 1975, incidence increased temporarily, associated with a serogroup
                        B serotype 2a strain. In 1985, another hyperendemic period began, associated with increased circulation of a hypervirulent ST32, B15:P1.16 strain. A
                        further hyperendemic period started in 1995-96, associated with an increased proportion of disease due to ST11 serogroup C serotype 2a infection. There was
                        a shift in age distribution towards teenagers and young adults, among whom case fatality ratios are particularly high.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meningococcal disease occurs in all countries. In the 'meningitis belt' of sub- Saharan Africa, the incidence of meningococcal infection rises sharply
                        towards the end of the dry, dusty season when disease spreads rapidly, resulting in large epidemics within very short periods. These are predominantly due
                        to serogroup A, but recent outbreaks have included serogroups W and X.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Increasing numbers of countries in sub-Saharan countries have already introduced Group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine into routine and catch-up
                        vaccination campaigns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Large epidemics of meningococcal disease have been linked to the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, resulting in importations into a number
                        of countries, including the UK. These were initially caused by serogroup A infection and immunisation against this strain became a requirement for entry to
                        Saudi Arabia. In 2000 and 2001, an increase in serogroup W infections followed the Hajj with a number of cases in UK pilgrims and their families (Hahne <em>et al</em>., 2002). Evidence of receipt of quadrivalent vaccine (serogroups A, C, Y, W) became an entry requirement in 2002.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meningococcal vaccines based solely on the serogroup C polysaccharide (often called 'plain' polysaccharide vaccines) provide only short-term protection to
                        older children and adults and do not protect infants. In the mid-1990s, meningococcal C (MenC) conjugate vaccines were therefore
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        developed that would provide longer-term protection and would be effective in infants. As the rate of meningococcal serogroup C infections continued to
                        rise, the development of the new vaccines was accelerated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In November 1999, MenC conjugate vaccine was introduced into the UK routine immunisation programme along with a catch-up campaign for older children,
                        adolescents and young adults up to 18 years. In January 2002, the campaign was extended to include adults under 25 years of age.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following the MenC vaccine campaign, the number of laboratory-confirmed serogroup C cases fell by over 90% in all age groups immunised (Figure 22.3)
                        (Campbell H, <em>et al</em>., 2010; Miller <em>et al</em>., 2001; Trotter <em>et al</em>., 2004). Cases in other age groups fell by approximately
                        two-thirds as a result of reduced carriage rates (Maiden <em>et al</em>., 2002) and reduced risk of exposure (Trotter <em>et al</em>., 2003). This indirect
                        protection (or herd immunity) has contributed to the number of cases falling and remaining at very low levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2006, following studies that showed that protection against meningococcal serogroup C waned during the second year of life (Trotter <em>et al</em>.,
                        2004), a booster dose (combined with Hib vaccine as Hib/MenC vaccine) was introduced at 12 months of age.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2013, despite continuing excellent disease control, increasing evidence showed that vaccination against meningococcal serogroup C disease in early
                        childhood provides short-term protective immune responses (Borrow <em>et al</em>., 2010; Kitchen <em>et al</em>., 2009; Perret <em>et al</em>., 2010), that
                        vaccination later in childhood provides higher levels of antibodies that persist for longer (Snape <em>et al</em>., 2008), and that meningococcal serogroup
                        C vaccination significantly reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of serogroup C meningococcus providing indirect protection through herd protection (Ramsay <em>et al</em>., 2003; Maiden <em>et al</em>., 2008). This led the JCVI to consider a further amendment to the schedule to sustain long term control by
                        providing high antibody levels into the age groups at which meningococcal carriage becomes more common. An adolescent booster dose at age 13-14 years was
                        added to the schedule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, JCVI considered a study that showed a single dose of some varieties of MenC vaccines at three months of age would be sufficient to prime
                        infants against meningococcal serogroup C disease, and provide protection for the first year of life (Findlow <em>et al</em>., 2011). Therefore the second
                        dose at 4 months of age was removed from the routine schedule in 2013.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Serogroup B strains now account for over 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases submitted to the Health Protection Agency (HPA) Meningococcal Reference Unit and
                        Scottish <em>Haemophilus</em>, <em>Legionella</em>, <em>Meningococcus</em> and <em>Pneumococcus</em> Reference Laboratory (SHLMPRL).

                        The MenC conjugate vaccines are made from capsular polysaccharide that has been extracted from cultures of serogroup C <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>. The
                        polysaccharide is linked (conjugated) to a carrier protein, according to the manufacturer's method. In the UK, MenC vaccines have been used that have been
                        conjugated with either CRM197 (a non-toxic variant of diphtheria toxin) or tetanus toxoid. The conjugation increases the immunogenicity, especially in
                        young children in whom the plain polysaccharide vaccines are less immunogenic. MenC vaccine confers no protection against other serogroups of meningococcal
                        disease, such as serogroups A, B, W or Y.

                        The Hib/MenC conjugate vaccine is made from capsular polysaccharides of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b and N<em>eisseria meningitidis</em>
                        serogroup C, which are both conjugated to tetanus toxoid. The vaccine has been shown to elicit booster responses to both Hib and MenC when given in the
                        second year of life to children who were primed in infancy with Hib and MenC conjugate vaccines.

                    <p>
                        The MenACWY conjugate vaccines are made from capsular polysaccharide that have been extracted from cultures of serogroup A, C, W and Y <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>. The polysaccharides are conjugated to a carrier protein, In the UK, MenACWY vaccines are conjugated with either CRM197 (a
                        non-toxic variant of diphtheria toxin) or tetanus toxoid. The process of conjugation improves the immunogenicity, especially in young children and older
                        people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although neither of the available vaccines is licensed for use in infants, data show a good antibody response to all serogroups after two doses of Menveo <sup>&#174;</sup> conjugate vaccine (Snape <em>et al</em>., 2008; Perrett <em>et al</em>., 2009). The responses are better than seen with the
                        polysaccharide vaccine (Borrow, 2009) and the response to serogroup C is comparable with that seen with the monovalent MenC conjugate vaccine (Southern <em>et al</em>., 2009). Based on this and the experience with other conjugate vaccines, immunity is expected to be higher, longer-lasting and confer less
                        risk of immunological tolerance than with the polysaccharide vaccine. For this reason, both conjugate vaccines are recommended in preference to
                        polysacharide vaccine in children from one to under five years of age. Menveo<sup>&#174;</sup> is recommended for use in children below one year of age as
                        there are some data on the use of Menveo<sup>&#174;</sup> in that age group.

                    <p>
                        The (non-conjugated) polysaccharide vaccine is made from the polysaccharide in the capsules of serogroups A, C, W and Y <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>
                        organisms. Young infants make some response to serogroup A, Y and W polysaccharides from three months of age (Peltola <em>et al</em>., 1985; Cadoz <em>et al</em>., 1985; Al-Mazrou <em>et al</em>., 2005). However, protection is not long-lasting as immunological memory is not induced. Vaccine-induced
                        immunity lasts approximately three to five years in older children and adults; in younger children, a more rapid decline in antibody has been noted
                        (Frasch, 1995). In addition, polysaccharide vaccine may induce immune hyporesponsiveness when immune responses to second and subsequent doses of the same
                        vaccine are attenuated (Jokhdar <em>et al</em>., 2004; Khalil <em>et al</em>., 2005). The response is strictly serogroup-specific and confers no protection
                        against serogroup B organisms.

                    <p>
                        Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&#730;C to +8&#730;C and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat
                        and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness of vaccines may be impaired if not stored
                        at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause hairline cracks in the
                        container, leading to contamination of the contents. For further information on storage see Chapter 3.

                    <p>
                        All meningococcal-containing vaccines are given intramuscularly into the upper arm or anterolateral thigh. This is to reduce the risk of localised
                        reactions, which are more common when the vaccine is given subcutaneously (Mark <em>et al</em>., 1999; Zuckerman, 2000; Diggle <em>et al</em>., 2000).
                        However, for individuals with a bleeding disorder, vaccines should be given by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meningococcal vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus,
                        pertussis, polio and Hib. The vaccines should be given at a separate site, preferably in a separate limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given
                        at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). The site at which each vaccine is given should be noted in the child's clinical record.

                    <p>
                        Meningitec<sup>&#174;</sup> vaccine does not provide adequate protection against meningococcal serogroup C disease when administered as single dose in
                        infancy, and is therefore no longer recommended for use in those less than 12 months of age. Should Meningitec<sup>&#174;</sup> have been given as part of
                        the infant schedule (for example inadvertently or overseas), a second dose of Men C vaccine (preferably one containing a CRM conjugate such as Meningitec <sup>&#174;</sup> or Menjugate Kit<sup>&#174;</sup>) should be given at least one month after the first dose.

                        When a child born in the UK presents with an inadequate immunisation history, every effort should be made to clarify what immunisations they may have had
                        (see Chapter 11). Children coming to the UK who have a history of immunisation in their country of origin may not have been offered protection with all the
                        antigens currently used in the UK, and they may not have received MenC-containing vaccines.

                        Children over the age of one and under the age of ten years who have not received any MenC vaccine should be offered a single dose of MenC or Hib/ MenC (if
                        they are also unvaccinated for Hib). The response at this age is very good even where no infant doses have been received. These children should still
                        receive the teenage booster when they reach the target age.

                        Children who reach the target age for the teenage booster who were vaccinated according to the previous vaccine schedules (without a toddler booster)
                        should be offered a single dose. Children above the age of ten years who have not received any MenC may receive the teenage booster early (See Table 22.2).

                        Children and adults with asplenia or splenic dysfunction may be at increased risk of invasive meningococcal infection. Such individuals, irrespective of
                        age or interval from splenectomy, may have a sub-optimal response to the vaccine (Balmer <em>et al</em>., 2004). Children and adults with complement

                        All travellers should undergo a careful risk assessment that takes into account their itinerary, duration of stay and planned activities. In some areas of
                        the world, the risk of acquiring meningococcal infection, particularly of developing serogroup A disease, is much higher than in the UK. Individuals who
                        are particularly at risk are visitors who live or travel 'rough', such as backpackers, and those living or working with local people. Large epidemics of
                        both serogroup A and W meningococcal infection have occurred in association with Hajj pilgrimages, and proof of vaccination against A, C, W and Y
                        serogroups is now a visa entry requirement for pilgrims and seasonal workers travelling to Saudi Arabia.

                        Epidemics, mainly of serogroup A and more recently serogroup W infections, occur unpredictably throughout tropical Africa but particularly in the savannah
                        during the dry season (December to June). Immunisation is recommended for long-stay or high-risk visitors to sub-Saharan Africa, for example, those who
                        will be living or working closely with local people, or those who are backpacking.

                        Both polysaccharide ACWY (ACWY Vax) and conjugate ACWY vaccines are available. In children under five years old, it is recommended that ACWY conjugate
                        vaccine be used in preference to ACWY Vax because of the better immune response and to reduce the risk of hyporesponsiveness (Jokhdar <em>et al</em>.,
                        2004; Khalil <em>et al</em>., 2005). In children aged over five years and adults, ACWY conjugate vaccine should be used in preference to the polysaccharide
                        vaccine to reduce the risk of hyporesponsiveness and to provide better protection. - see <i>Table 22.4 below.</i>

                            Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be
                            postponed until they have recovered fully. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any signs or
                            symptoms to the adverse effects of the vaccine.

                            Meningococcal vaccines may be given to pregnant women when clinically indicated. There is no evidence of risk from vaccinating pregnant women or those who
                            are breast-feeding with inactivated virus or bacterial vaccines or toxoids (Granoff <em>et al</em>., 2008). In cases where meningococcal immunisation has
                            been inadvertently given in pregnancy, there has been no evidence of fetal problems.

                            It is important that premature infants have their immunisations at the appropriate chronological age, according to the schedule. The occurrence of apnoea
                            following vaccination is especially increased in infants who were born very prematurely.

                            Very premature infants (born &#8804; 28 weeks of gestation) who are in hospital should have respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs when given their first
                            immunisation, particularly those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. If the child has apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations after the first
                            immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital, with respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs (Ohlsson <em>et al</em>., 2004; Pfister <em>et al</em>., 2004; Schulzke <em>et al</em>., 2005; Pourcyrous <em>et al</em>., 2007; Klein <em>et al</em>., 2008).

                        Current recommendations from NICE are that children and young people with suspected bacterial meningitis without non-blanching rash should be transferred
                        directly to secondary care without giving parenteral antibiotics. If urgent transfer to hospital is not possible (for example, in remote locations or
                        because of adverse weather conditions), antibiotics should be administered to children and young people with suspected bacterial meningitis.

                        For suspected meningococcal disease (meningitis with non-blanching rash or meningococcal septicaemia) parenteral antibiotics (intramuscular or intravenous
                        benzylpenicillin) should be given at the earliest opportunity, either in primary or secondary care, but urgent transfer to hospital should not be delayed
                        in order to give the parenteral antibiotics.

                        For public health management of contacts of cases and outbreaks, advice must be sought from the local health protection unit. Household contacts of cases
                        of meningococcal infection are at increased risk of developing the disease. This risk is highest in the first seven days following onset in the index case
                        but persists for at least four weeks. Immediate risk can be reduced by the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis to the whole contact group.

                        For prophylaxis, the use of single dose ciprofloxacin is now recommended in preference to rifampicin, particularly because it is a single dose and is
                        readily available in high street pharmacies. Ciprofloxacin as a single dose of 500mg may be given for adults (250mg for children aged five to 12 years and
                        125mg for those aged one month to four years). Alternative options are discussed at www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1194947389261

                        dose of MenC conjugate vaccine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For confirmed serogroup A, W or Y infections, vaccination with a quadrivalent conjugate vaccine should be offered to all close contacts of any age (two
                        doses one month apart if aged under one year; one dose in older individuals).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MenC conjugate vaccine should also be offered according to the recommended national schedule to any unimmunised index cases under the age of 25 years
                        (whatever the serogroup). Although recurrent serogroup C disease is rare, this policy ensures that persons in this age group are given equivalent
                        protection to their age-matched immunised peers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chemoprophylaxis should be given as soon as possible, while the decision to offer vaccine should be made when the results of serogrouping are available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> Any case provides an opportunity to check the MenC vaccine status of the index case and contacts, and to ensure that individuals under the age of 25
                            years have been fully immunised according to the UK schedule. Current vaccines do not protect against serogroup B meningococcal infection. </strong>
