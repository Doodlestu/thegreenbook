                        <p>
                            Anthrax is a bacterial disease which primarily affects herbivorous animals, although all mammals are susceptible to infection. In humans, anthrax can affect the skin and, rarely, the respiratory or gastro-intestinal tract. It is caused by the <i>aerobic bacillus</i>, <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, and is spread by spores. Spores can be found in animal products such as wool, hair, hides, skins, bones, bonemeal and in the carcasses of infected animals. The spores can also contaminate soil and may survive for many years.
                        </p>
                        <p>The incubation period is usually 48 hours but can be up to seven days. In cutaneous anthrax, a lesion appears on the skin and develops into a characteristic ulcer with a black centre. Inhalational anthrax begins with a flu-like illness and is followed by respiratory compromise and shock around two to six days later. Intestinal anthrax results in severe abdominal pain, fever and bloody diarrhoea.</p>
                        <p>Anthrax can be treated effectively with antibiotics if identified early. If untreated, the infection can cause septicaemia, toxaemia or meningitis, and is fatal in around 5% of cases.</p>
                        <p>In the UK, human anthrax is rare, and is almost entirely an occupational disease affecting those handling imported infected animal products or working with infected animals (see Table 13.1). Prevention depends on controlling anthrax in livestock and on disinfecting, washing and scouring imported animal products. Processing of hides, wool and bone by tanning, dyeing, carbonising or acid treatment also reduces the risk of infection. Bonemeal used as horticultural fertiliser may rarely contain anthrax spores when not correctly treated in the country of origin; a certificate of sterilisation should accompany any consignment on entry to the UK. Those handling bonemeal in bulk should wear impervious gloves that should be destroyed after use.</p>

                        <p>Anthrax spores have been used as biological weapons, most recently reported in the USA (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004). Guidance on assessment and management of this type of risk is not included in this chapter and can be found elsewhere (<a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.hpa.org.uk', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">www.hpa.org.uk</a>).</p>
                        <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>
                        <p>Anthrax is well documented in ancient historical texts and has been a notifiable disease in the UK since 1895. Vaccination for UK workers at risk was first introduced in 1965 and limited studies suggest that vaccination provides good protection against occupationally acquired infection (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004). In the period 1961-80, there was a decrease in the number of reported cases. Human anthrax is uncommon in the UK with only a handful of cases being notified over the last decade.</p>
                        <p>Human infections occur in countries where the disease is common in animals including those in the Southern and Central Americas, Southern and Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>

                        The vaccine is made from antigens found in the sterile filtrate from cultures of the Sterne strain of <i>B. anthracis</i>. These antigens are adsorbed onto an aluminium adjuvant to improve their immunogenicity and are preserved with thiomersal.
                    </p>
                    <p>The vaccine is inactivated, does not contain live organisms and cannot cause the disease against which it protects.</p>
                    <p>
                        There have been no formal efficacy trials with the UK vaccine. In 1958, the introduction of vaccine successfully controlled cutaneous anthrax at a government wool-disinfecting station in Liverpool (Hambleton <i>et al</i>., 1984). A controlled clinical trial was carried out in the 1950s among workers in goat-hair mills in New Hampshire, USA, using a vaccine similar to that currently licensed in the USA and the UK (Brachman <i>et al</i>., 1962). Although the study did not have sufficient power to accurately measure protection against pulmonary anthrax, no cases occurred in the vaccinated group compared with five in the unvaccinated.
                    </p>
                    <p>There have been no recorded cases of anthrax infection in individuals vaccinated in the UK.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>
                    <p>Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&deg;;  C to +8&deg;;  C and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless they have been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause hairline cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Presentation</div>
                    <p>Anthrax vaccine is presented as a suspension ready for injection, which should be shaken before administration.</p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Administration</div>
                    <p>The vaccine is given by intramuscular injection, preferably into the upper arm. However, individuals with a bleeding disorder should be given the vaccine by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.</p>
                    <p>Anthrax vaccine can be given at the same time as other vaccines. The vaccines should be given at separate sites, preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003). The site at which each vaccine is given and the batch numbers of the vaccines should be recorded in the individual&#146;s records. It is recommended that the employer keeps a vaccination record.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Disposal</div>
                    <p>Equipment used for vaccination, including used vials or ampoules, should be disposed of at the end of a session by sealing in a proper, puncture-resistant 'sharps' box (UN-approved, BS 7320).</p>

                    <p>Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to post- pone immunisation.</p>
                    <p>Unless protection is needed urgently, immunisation may be postponed in acutely unwell individuals until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid wrongly attributing any new symptom or the progression of symptoms to the vaccine. </p>

                    <p>Anthrax vaccine may be given to pregnant women when clinically indicated. There is no evidence of risk from vaccinating pregnant women or those who are breast-feeding with inactivated viral or bacterial vaccines or toxoids (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004).</p>

                    <p>Individuals with immunosuppression and HIV infection (regardless of CD4 count) should be given anthrax vaccine if indicated. These individuals may not make a full antibody response. Specialist advice may be required.</p>

                    <p>Pain, swelling or redness at the injection site are common and may last for two or more days. Such reactions have been reported to occur at the site of a previous anthrax injection. Regional lymphadenopathy, mild febrile reactions, flu-like symptoms, urticaria or other allergic reactions occur less commonly. Local or general reactions to the first injection are not good predictors of reactions to second or subsequent doses.</p>
                    <p>All serious suspected adverse reactions to vaccines in adults should be reported to the Commission on Human Medicines through the Yellow Card scheme.</p>

                    <p>All cases of anthrax must be notified. An attempt should be made to confirm the diagnosis bacteriologically and the source of infection should be investigated. Transmission from person to person is very rare and, therefore, neither quarantine nor vaccination are used to control spread. Ciprofloxacin is the treatment of choice. Skin lesions should be covered; any discharge or soiled articles should be disinfected. </p>
                    <p>Guidance on exposure to potentially infected material is available on the Health Protection Agency website.
