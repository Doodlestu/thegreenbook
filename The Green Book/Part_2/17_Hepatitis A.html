                        Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by hepatitis A virus. The disease is generally mild, but severity tends to increase with age. Asymptomatic
                        disease is common in children. Jaundice may occur in 70-80% of those infected as adults. Fulminant hepatitis can occur but is rare. The overall case-
                        fatality ratio is low but is greater in older patients and those with pre-existing liver disease. There is no chronic carrier state and chronic liver
                        damage does not occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The virus is usually transmitted by the faecal-oral route through person-to- person spread or contaminated food or drink. Foodborne outbreaks have been
                        reported following ingestion of certain shellfish (bivalve molluscs such as mussels, oysters and clams that feed by filtering large volumes of sewage
                        polluted waters) and salad vegetables. Transmission of hepatitis A has been associated with the use of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates where viral
                        inactivation procedures did not destroy hepatitis A virus. The incubation period is usually around 28-30 days but may occasionally be as little as 15 or as
                        much as 50 days.

                    <p>
                        Improved standards of living and hygiene have led to a marked fall in the incidence of hepatitis A infection. In the UK, this has resulted in high
                        susceptibility levels in adults, with the typical age of infection shifting from children to older age groups. In 1996, the overall seroprevalence of
                        hepatitis A in England and Wales was estimated to be 31%, and was 11% among those aged 10-19 years (Morris <em>et al</em>., 2002). Therefore, the majority
                        of adolescents and adults remain susceptible to hepatitis A infection and will remain so throughout life, with the potential for outbreaks to occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hepatitis A infection acquired in the UK may either present as sporadic cases, as community-wide outbreaks resulting from person-to-person transmission or,
                        uncommonly, as point of source outbreaks related to contaminated food. Previously, the incidence of hepatitis A showed a cyclical pattern in the UK.
                        However, there has been no peak in incidence since 1990 when 7545 cases
                    </p>

                    <!--Fig to go in-->Figure 17.1 Number of laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A reports in England and Wales and Scotland (1983-2005)

                    <p>
                        were reported for England and Wales. There were 669 reports in 2004 (HPA, 2005). In Scotland, 26 cases of hepatitis A infection
                        were reported to Health Protection Scotland (formerly the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH)) in 2005. This is the lowest
                        annual number of acute cases ever recorded. Acute hepatitis A infection had been observed to decrease steadily in Scotland from 1993 (241 cases) to 2000
                        (50 cases).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In recent decades in the UK, there has been a number of outbreaks of hepatitis A among men who have sex with men (MSM). Similarly, outbreaks have also been
                        documented in a number of other European countries. Transmission appears to be by the faecal-oral route. Some studies have shown associations with multiple
                        anonymous sexual contacts, particularly in ‘darkrooms’ or clubs (Reintjes <em>et al</em>., 1999; Bell <em>et al</em>., 2001).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outbreaks of hepatitis A have also been documented among injecting drug users in several countries. An outbreak among injecting drug users in Aberdeen (Roy
                    </p>
                    <em>et al</em>
                    <p>
                        ., 2004) contributed to a major increase in the number of cases in Scotland in 2001 (148 cases). Recently, outbreaks of hepatitis A in other parts of the UK have involved a high proportion of individuals with a history of injecting and homeless people living together in hostels and shelters (O’Donovan <em>et al</em>., 2001; Syed <em>et al</em>., 2003; Perrett <em>et al</em>., 2003). Close contact and poor standards of personal hygiene among these groups, with possible faecal contamination of shared injecting equipment or drugs, appears to be the most likely mode of transmission (Hutin <em>et al</em>., 2000; Roy <em>et al</em>., 2004).
                        Hepatitis A is more common in countries outside Northern and Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. Travel abroad is a common factor in sporadic cases in the UK. The highest risk areas for UK travellers are the Indian subcontinent and the Far East, but the risk extends to Eastern Europe.

                        There are two products for immunisation against hepatitis A. An immunoglobulin provides rapid but temporary immunity. The vaccine confers active immunity
                        but response is not immediate. Vaccines are available as either monovalent, or combined with either typhoid or hepatitis B.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hepatitis A monovalent vaccines and those combined with either typhoid or hepatitis B do not contain thiomersal. The vaccines are inactivated, do not
                        contain live organisms and cannot cause the diseases against which they protect.

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Monovalent vaccines</div>

                    <p>
                        Four monovalent vaccines are currently available, prepared from different strains of the hepatitis A virus; all are grown in human diploid cells (MRC5).
                        Three (Havrix&reg;, Vaqta&reg; and Avaxim&reg;) are adsorbed onto an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. The fourth, Epaxal&reg; vaccine, contains formalin-inactivated hepatitis
                        A particles attached to phospholipid vesicles together with influenza virus haemagglutinin derived from inactivated influenza virus H1N1 (Gluck <em>et al</em>., 1992; Loutan <em>et al</em>., 1994). These vaccines can be used interchangeably (Bryan <em>et al</em>., 2000; Clarke <em>et al</em>.,
                        2001; Beck <em>et al</em>., 2004).

                        Combined vaccines containing purified inactivated hepatitis A virus and purified recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide
                        (Twinrix&reg;) or aluminium phosphate (Ambirix&reg;), may be used when protection against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B infections is required. If rapid
                        protection against hepatitis A is required for adults, for example following exposure or during outbreaks, then a single dose of monovalent vaccine is
                        recommended. In children under 16 years, a single dose of Ambirix&reg; may also be used for rapid protection against hepatitis A. Both vaccines contain the
                        higher amount of hepatitis A antigen and will therefore provide hepatitis A protection more quickly than Twinrix.&reg;

                        vaccine (Hepatyrix&reg; or ViATIM&reg;) may be used where protection against hepatitis A and typhoid fever is required (see also Chapter 34 on typhoid).

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Human normal immunoglobulin</div>

                    <p>
                        Human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) is prepared from pooled plasma derived from blood donations. Use of HNIG should be limited to situations where it may
                        have a definite advantage over vaccine. HNIG can provide immediate protection, although antibody levels are lower than those eventually produced by
                        hepatitis A vaccine. There have been no studies directly comparing the efficacy of HNIG with vaccine for prophylaxis in contacts of cases. HNIG licensed
                        for use for prophylaxis must have a hepatitis A antibody level of at least 100IU/ml.*
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of a theoretical risk of transmission of vCJD from plasma products, HNIG used in the UK is now prepared from plasma sourced from outside the UK,
                        and supplies are scarce. All donors are screened for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and all plasma pools are tested for the presence of RNA from these viruses. A
                        solvent detergent inactivation step for envelope viruses is included in the production process.

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>

                    <p>
                        Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&#176;C to +8&#176;C and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat and cold.
                        Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless they have
                        been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause hairline
                        cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HNIG should be stored in the original packaging in a refrigerator at +2&#176;C to +8&#176;C. These products are tolerant to higher ambient temperatures for up to one
                        week. They can be distributed in sturdy packaging outside the cold chain, if needed.

                                        The immunisation regimes for hepatitis A vaccine and for combined hepatitis A and typhoid vaccine consist of a single dose. The standard schedule for the
                                        combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine depends on the product. For Twinrix&reg; the schedule consists of three doses, the first on the elected date, the
                                        second one month later and the third six months after the first dose. For Ambirix&reg; the schedule consists of two doses, the first administered on the
                                        elected date and the second between six and twelve months after the first dose.

                                    <p>
                                        An accelerated schedule of Twinrix Adult&reg; at 0, 7 and 21 days may be used when early protection against hepatitis B is required (e.g. for travellers
                                        departing within one month).

                    <p>
                        Vaccines are routinely given into the upper arm or anterolateral thigh. However, for individuals with a bleeding disorder, vaccines should be given by deep
                        subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Hepatitis A-containing vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as hepatitis B, MMR, MenC, Td/IPV and other travel vaccines. The
                        vaccines should be given at a separate site, preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American
                        Academy of Pediatrics, 2003). The site at which each vaccine was given should be noted in the individual's records.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        HNIG can be administered in the upper outer quadrant of the buttock or anterolateral thigh (see Chapter 4). If more than 3ml is to be given to young
                        children and infants, or more than 5ml to older children and adults, the immunoglobulin should be divided into smaller amounts and administered at
                        different sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HNIG may be administered, at a different site, at the same time as hepatitis A vaccine.

                    <p>
                        Equipment used for vaccination, including used vials, ampoules, or partially discharged vaccines should be disposed of at the end of a session by sealing
                        in a proper, puncture-resistant 'sharps' box according to local authority regulations and guidance in the technical memorandum 07-01 (Department of Health,
                        2006).

                    <p>The objective of the immunisation programme is to provide two doses of a hepatitis A-containing vaccine at appropriate intervals for all individuals at high risk of exposure to the virus or of complications from the disease. </p>

                    <p>
                        Immunisation with hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for those aged one year and over travelling to areas of moderate or high endemicity, such as the
                        Indian subcontinent, for prolonged periods, particularly if sanitation and food hygiene is likely to be poor. Vaccine is also recommended for all
                        individuals going to reside in or likely to be posted for long periods to hepatitis A virus-endemic countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although hepatitis A is usually sub-clinical in children, it can be severe and require hospitalisation. Even children who acquire mild or sub-clinical
                        hepatitis A may be a source of infection to others. The risks of disease for children under one year old are low, and vaccines are not licensed for their
                        use at this age. Care should be taken to prevent exposure to hepatitis A infection through food and water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For travellers, vaccine should preferably be given at least two weeks before departure, but can be given up to the day of departure. Although antibodies
                        may not be detectable for 12-15 days following administration of monovalent hepatitis A vaccine, the vaccine may provide some protection before antibodies
                        can be detected using current assays.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Immunisation is not considered necessary for individuals travelling to or going to reside in Northern or Western Europe (including Spain, Portugal and
                        Italy), or North America, Australia or New Zealand. HNIG is no longer recommended for travel prophylaxis. Country-by-country recommendations for hepatitis
                        A and other travel vaccines are given in <em>Health information for overseas travel </em>(www.nathnac.org).

                    <p>Although patients with chronic liver disease may be at no greater risk of acquiring hepatitis A infection, it can produce a more serious illness in these patients (Akriviadis and Redeker, 1989; Keefe, 1995). Immunisation against hepatitis A is therefore recommended for patients with severe liver disease of whatever cause. Vaccine should also be considered for individuals with chronic hepatitis B or C infection and for those with milder forms of liver disease.</p>

                    <p>As standard viral inactivation processes may not be effective against hepatitis A, patients with haemophilia who are receiving plasma-derived clotting factors should be immunised against hepatitis A. Patients with haemophilia should be immunised subcutaneously.</p>

                    <p>MSM with multiple sexual partners need to be informed about the risks of hepatitis A, and about the need to maintain high standards of personal hygiene. Immunisation should be offered to such individuals, particularly during periods when outbreaks are occurring. </p>

                                <p> outbreaks of hepatitis A have been associated with large residential institutions for those with learning difficulties. Transmission can occur more readily in such institutions and immunisation of staff and residents is appropriate. Similar considerations apply in other institutions where standards of personal hygiene among clients or patients may be poor.

                                raw, untreated sewage is frequently contaminated with hepatitis A. A UK study to evaluate this risk showed that frequent occupational exposure to raw sewage was an independent risk factor for hepatitis A infection (Brugha <em>et al</em>., 1998). Immunisation is, therefore, recommended for workers at risk of repeated exposure to raw sewage, who should be identified following a local risk assessment.

Under normal circumstances, the risk of transmission to staff and children can be minimised by careful attention to personal hygiene. However, in the case of a well-defined community outbreak, such as in a pre-school nursery, the need for immunisation of staff and children should be discussed with the local Health Protection Team.<br>

                        Either passive or active immunisation, or a combination of the two, is available for the management of contacts of cases and for outbreak control. There
                        have been no trials directly comparing the efficacy of hepatitis A vaccine alone against HNIG in the management of contacts. HNIG is preferred when
                        protection is required in a shorter time than it takes for a protective antibody response to the vaccine. Vaccine and HNIG may be given at the same time,
                        but in different sites, when both rapid and prolonged protection is required. A single dose of monovalent hepatitis A vaccine will provide more rapid
                        protection than the combined preparations where more than one dose is required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HNIG has a proven record in providing prophylaxis for contacts of cases of acute hepatitis A. HNIG will protect against hepatitis A infection if
                        administered within 14 days of exposure, and may modify disease if given after that time (Winokur and Stapleton, 1992). Protection lasts for four to six
                        months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is some evidence that vaccine may be effective in preventing infection in contacts of cases, provided it can be given soon enough after the onset of
                        symptoms in the index case. A study in Naples (Sagliocca <em>et al</em>., 1999) showed hepatitis A vaccine had a 79% protective efficacy in household
                        contacts of people with sporadic infection, where 56% of contacts received vaccine within four days of onset of symptoms in the index cases, and all within
                        eight days. If vaccine is to be used in preference to HNIG for prophylaxis of contacts, cases of acute hepatitis A will need to be diagnosed and reported
                        to public health officials quickly enough to allow administration of vaccine within one week of onset.
                    </p>
                    <div id="fourthtitle">Contacts of cases of hepatitis A infection</div>
                    <p>
                        Hepatitis A vaccine should be given to previously unvaccinated contacts of cases of hepatitis A with onset of jaundice within the last week. When the
                        interval is longer, HNIG should be used, particularly for older people, given the greater severity of disease in this age group. Further guidance on the
                        management of contacts is available in ‘Guidelines for the control of hepatitis A virus infection’ (Crowcroft <em>et al</em>., 2001).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prophylaxis restricted to household and close contacts may be relatively ineffective in controlling further spread. If given to a wider social group of
                        recent household visitors (kissing contacts and those who have eaten food prepared by an index case), spread may be prevented more effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a food handler develops acute jaundice or is diagnosed clinically or serologically with hepatitis A infection, the local Health Protection Team should
                        be immediately informed by telephone. This will allow a timely risk assessment of whether other food handlers in the same food preparation area could have
                        been exposed and should be considered for post-exposure prophylaxis. Rapid serological confirmation and notification of hepatitis A infection will allow an
                        assessment of the possible risks to any customers who can be traced and offered prophylaxis.<strong> </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further prophylaxis will not be required in immunocompetent contacts who have previously received hepatitis A vaccine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a contact is at ongoing risk of hepatitis A infection because of their lifestyle or any other reason, then they should be offered vaccine irrespective
                        of whether they are offered HNIG.

                    <p>
                        Active immunisation with monovalent hepatitis A vaccine provides longer duration of protection, and will be more effective in prolonged outbreaks, such as
                        those that may occur among MSM or injecting drug users, where transmissions may continue after the protective effects of HNIG have ceased.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The appropriate approach to the management of outbreaks of hepatitis A infection with HNIG and/or hepatitis A vaccine should be discussed with the local
                        Health Protection Team. Further guidance on the management of outbreaks is available in ‘Guidelines for the control of hepatitis A virus infection’
                        (Crowcroft <em>et al</em>., 2001).

                    <p>
                        The primary immunisation course for hepatitis A vaccine and for combined Hepatitis A and typhoid vaccine consists of a single dose. For adult combined
                        hepatitis A and B vaccines (Twinrix&reg;) a primary course consists of three doses. There are two combined hepatitis A and B vaccines suitable for use in
                        children. A primary course of Twinrix consists of three doses, whereas Ambirix&reg; consists of two doses at a longer interval. The first dose of Ambirix&reg;,
                        however, provides equivalent protection to a primary course of single hepatitis A vaccine, although protection against hepatitis B is not complete until
                        after the second dose. Protection from a primary course of single or combined vaccines lasts for at least one year.
                    </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Reinforcing immunisation</div>
                    <p>
                        A booster dose of hepatitis A vaccine should be given at six to 12 months after the initial dose. This results in a substantial increase in the antibody
                        titre and will give immunity beyond ten years, however, effective protection beyond ten years cannot be assured until this booster is given. Until further
                        evidence is available on persistence of protective immunity, a further booster at 25 years is indicated for those at ongoing risk (Van Damme, 2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where a combined hepatitis A and typhoid vaccine has been used to initiate immunisation, a dose of single antigen hepatitis A vaccine will be required six
                        to 12 months later in order to provide prolonged protection against hepatitis A infection. Booster doses of the typhoid component will be required at three
                        years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For individuals who have received combined hepatitis A and B vaccine in an accelerated schedule, a booster dose is required at one year.
                    </p>
                    <div id="fourthtitle">Delayed administration of the booster dose </div>
                    <p>
                        Ideally, the manufacturers&#39; recommended timing for the administration of the booster dose of hepatitis A vaccine should be followed. In practice, and
                        particularly in infrequent travellers, there may be a delay in accessing this injection. Studies have shown that successful boosting can occur even when
                        the second dose is delayed for several years (Landry <em>et al</em>., 2001; Beck <em>et al</em>., 2003), so a course does not need to be re-started.

                        Adverse reactions to hepatitis A vaccines are usually mild and confined to the first few days after immunisation. The most common reactions are mild,
                        transient soreness, erythema and induration at the injection site. A small, painless nodule may form at the injection site; this usually disappears and is
                        of no consequence.
