                        Rotaviruses are ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses that are contained within a protein capsule. Rotavirus strains are classified based on the outer layer proteins VP7 (G type) and VP4 (P type). Although there are at least 15 G types and 28 P types, only 10 G and 11 P types have been identified in humans (Desselberger <i>et al</i>., 2001).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rotavirus is highly contagious. Transmission by the faecal-oral route is most frequent, although respiratory transmission may also occur (Glass <i>et al</i>., 2006). Although good hygiene measures can help prevent spread of the disease, the robustness of rotavirus and the low infectious dose (10-100 virus particles), makes standard sanitary measures to halt transmission of the virus relatively ineffective (Gray, 2011).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rotavirus infections in humans cause gastroenteritis that usually lasts from three to eight days (Glass <i>et al</i>., 2006). Rotavirus gastroenteritis is characterised by mild fever with severe diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and can lead to dehydration. Nearly all children will have at least one episode of rotavirus gastroenteritis before reaching five years of age. An estimated 130,000 children will visit their GP and approximately 12,700 children with rotavirus gastroenteritis will be hospitalised in England and Wales every year (Djuretic <i>et al</i>., 1999; Jit & Edmunds, 2007). Although deaths from rotavirus in the UK are rare, the numbers are difficult to quantify accurately: it has been estimated that there may be up to three to four rotavirus associated deaths a year in England and Wales (Jit <i>et al</i>., 2007). In developing countries, deaths from rotavirus infection are far more common with the severe diarrhoea and dehydration that results from gastroenteritis -the main cause of rotavirus- associated deaths.
                    </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>
                    <p>
                        Rotavirus infection in the UK is seasonal (see figure 1), occurring mostly in winter and early spring (January to March). People of any age can be infected by rotavirus but most infections occur in children between one month and four years of age (see figure 2). Infection in newborns is common but tends to be either mild or asymptomatic, probably because of protection by circulating maternal antibodies (Grillner <i>et al</i>., 1985; Bishop, 1994). Infections are often recurrent, and, by three years of age, many children will have experienced infection on more than one occasion (Brussow <i>et al</i>., 1988). Once someone has had a rotavirus infection they usually develop immunity, although it may be short lived (Bishop, 1994). Second and subsequent infections with a strain previously encountered are often asymptomatic; symptomatic second infections are usually associated with a different genotype.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Infections in adults are rarely reported, although they are not uncommon in individuals caring for, or in contact with, children who have rotavirus gastroenteritis. Older children and adults can also develop asymptomatic infection, which may be important in maintaining rotavirus infection in the community (Hardy, 1987). Rotavirus serotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], and G9P[8] account for around 82% of all the rotavirus serotypes that are in circulation in the UK (Iturriza-Gomara <i>et al</i>., 2008a) with G1P[8] the most common circulating strain between 2010 and 2012.
                    </p>
                    <p>The main obstacle to calculating the burden of rotavirus disease is that the symptoms of the infection are similar to those of a number of other viruses and bacteria. In addition, most cases of gastroenteritis presenting to the health service do not include laboratory confirmation of the causal organism.</p>
                    <p>
                        Using various surveillance and diagnostic methods and techniques, it is estimated that rotavirus infections cause around half of all gastroenteritis in children aged under five years. In addition, although there has been a downward trend in the number of cases of gastroenteritis caused by bacteria and parasites in young children over the last ten years, the proportion of gastroenteritis cases due to viruses, and to rotavirus in particular, has remained stable (Iturriza-Gomara <i>et al</i>., 2008a).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rotavirus infection may also be acquired in hospital. A third of rotavirus infections among hospitalised patients in the USA were found to have been acquired in hospital (Fischer <i>et al</i>., 2004). Several other papers have also documented the importance of rotavirus infection in hospital-acquired gastroenteritis (Chandran <i>et al</i>., 2006; Gleizes <i>et al</i>., 2006).

                        There are two rotavirus vaccines authorised for use by the European Medicines Agency, Rotarix&#174; (manufactured by GSK) and RotaTeq&#174; (manufactured
                        by Sanofi Pasteur MSD). Both are highly effective at preventing rotavirus infection in infants. However, the vaccines are not known to be interchangeable
                        and a course of vaccine started with one product should be completed with the same vaccine to achieve full protection. Neither vaccine contains thiomersal
                        nor any adjuvant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rotarix&#174; is the vaccine offered as part of the UK national childhood immunisation programme. It is a live attenuated vaccine derived from a virus
                        initially isolated from a 15-month-old child and then attenuated by serial cell culture passage (De Vos <em>et al.,</em> 2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In clinical trials Rotarix&#174; has been shown to protect against gastroenteritis due to rotavirus serotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], and G9P[8];
                        some efficacy against uncommon rotavirus genotypes G8P[4] and G12P[6] has also been demonstrated. The vaccine is over 85% effective at protecting against
                        severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in the first two years of life (Salinas <em>et al.,</em> 2005; Ruiz-Palacios <em>et al.,</em> 2006; Vesikari <em>et al.,</em> 2006; Vesikari <em>et al.,</em> 2007; Soares-Weiser K <em>et al</em>., 2012). The effectiveness of the vaccine in protecting against any
                        rotavirus infection varies between the serotypes listed.
                    </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Storage(see Chapter 3)</div>

                    <p>
                        Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&degC to +8&degC and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat
                        or cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness will be reduced for vaccines unless they
                        have been stored at the correct temperature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for Rotarix&#174;.

                    <p align="left">
                        It is preferable that the full course of two doses of Rotarix&#174; be completed before 16 weeks of age, allowing at least four weeks between the
                        first and second dose. This is to provide early protection and avoid temporal association between vaccination and intussusception.
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">
                        In line with recommendations from WHO, infants should only receive the first dose of Rotarix&#174; if they are younger than 15 weeks of age.
                        Infants who receive the first dose before week 15 should receive the second dose of vaccine by 24 weeks of age. If the course is interrupted, it
                        should be resumed but not repeated, provided that the second dose can be given before the 24 week cut-off.
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">
                        Children who inadvertently receive the first dose of rotavirus vaccine at age 15 weeks or older should still receive their second dose at least
                        four weeks later - providing that they will still be under 24 weeks of age at the time. The reason for the 15 week age limit is to minimise a
                        potential risk of intussusception (see<strong> Adverse reactions</strong> below)
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">
                        No specific clinical action needs to be taken if the first dose of vaccine is inadvertently given after 15 weeks and zero days of age or if the
                        second dose is given after 24 weeks of age. For both situations, immunisers should be reminded of the age restrictions for Rotarix&#174;, even if
                        infants are unable to start or complete the two dose schedule as a consequence of these restrictions.

                        Rotavirus vaccine can be given at the same time as the other vaccines administered as part of the routine childhood immunisation
                        programme, including BCG, and so should ideally be given at the scheduled two month and three month vaccination visits (see above). However, rotavirus
                        vaccine can be given at any time before or after the routine infant immunisations and at any time before or after BCG vaccine. The recommendation for
                        administering live vaccines either at the same time or after an interval of four weeks only applies to injectable live viral vaccines and, therefore, not

                        disposed of at the end of a session by sealing in a proper, puncture-resistant 'sharps' box according to local authority regulations and guidance in the
                        technical memorandum 07-01 (Department of Health, 2006). Recommendations for use of the vaccine The objective of the rotavirus immunisation programme is to
                        provide two doses of Rotarix&#174; vaccine to infants from six weeks of age and before 24 weeks of age in order to prevent severe gastroenteritis due to
                        rotavirus. Infants aged under six weeks Rotarix&#174; should not be given to infants under 6 weeks of age. Infants aged 6 weeks to under 15 weeks The
                        minimum age for the first dose of Rotarix&#174; is 6 weeks 0 days, the maximum age for the first dose is 14 weeks and 6 days. Infants aged 15 weeks to
                        under 24 weeks Vaccination with Rotarix&#174; should not be started for infants aged 15 weeks and 0 days or older. Infants who have received their first
                        dose of vaccine under 15 weeks and 0 days of age should receive their second dose of Rotarix&#174; after a minimum interval of 4 weeks and by 23 weeks and
                        6 days of age. Infants aged 24 weeks or older Rotarix&#174; vaccine should not be given to an infant who is 24 weeks and 0 days of age or older.

                        Other minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may
                        be postponed until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any signs
                        or symptoms to the adverse effects of the vaccine.
                        <p> The vaccine contains a live attenuated virus, and there is limited evidence of safety and efficacy data
                            in infants with immunosuppression; other than severe combined immune deficiency (where the vaccine should not be offered) the vaccine may be considered.</p>

                    <p>
                        Administration of rotavirus vaccine to hospitalised infants, including preterm infants in neonatal units, is likely to carry a low risk for transmission of
                        the vaccine virus if standard infection control precautions are maintained. Furthermore, the rotavirus vaccine is highly attenuated and does not revert to
                        a high virulence strain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, provided that the infant is clinically stable, vaccination should not be delayed, particularly if the delay risks being too late to give the
                        vaccine or giving the first dose of vaccine closer to the upper age limit of 15 weeks. Similarly, if a recently vaccinated child is hospitalised for any
                        reason, no precautions other than routine standard infection control precautions need to be taken to prevent the spread of vaccine virus in the hospital
                        setting

                    <p>
                        Rotavirus vaccine should not be administered to infants known to have severe combined immunodeficency (SCID). There is a lack of safety and efficacy data
                        on the administration of rotavirus vaccine to infants with other immuno- suppressive disorders. Given the high risk of exposure to natural rotavirus,
                        however, the benefits of administration is likely to outweigh any theoretical risks and therefore should be actively considered, if necessary in
                        collaboration with the clinician dealing with child's underlying condition. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        However, in a clinical study, 100 infants with HIV infection were administered Rotarix&#174; lyophilised formulation or placebo. The safety profile was
                        similar between Rotarix&#174; and placebo recipients (Steele et al., 2011). Therefore, vaccination is advised in HIV infected infants. Additionally,
                        infants with unknown HIV status but born to HIV positive mothers should be offered vaccination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a potential for transmission of live attenuated vaccine in Rotarix&#174; from the infant to severely immunocompromised contacts through faecal
                        material for at least 14 days (Anderson, 2008). However, vaccination of the infant will offer protection to household contacts from wild-type rotavirus
                        disease and outweigh any risk from transmission of vaccine virus to any immunocompromised close contacts. Those in close contact with recently vaccinated
                        infants should observe good personal hygiene.

                        The most common adverse reactions observed after administration of Rotarix&#174; vaccine administration are diarrhoea and irritability. Other reactions
                        commonly reported are vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, skin inflammation, regurgitation of food, fever and loss of appetite. A detailed list of
                        adverse reactions associated with Rotarix&#174; is available in the Summary of Product Characteristics for this vaccine, which is available from the
                        European Medicines Agency website. Intussusception is a naturally-occurring condition where the part of the intestine prolapses, or telescopes, into
                        another part causing an obstruction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Intussusception has a background annual incidence of around 120 cases per 100,000 children aged under one year (WHO, 2002). The background risk of
                    intussusception in the UK increases to peak at around 5 months of age (Gay N, Lancet 1999). Research from some countries suggests that Rotarix&#174; may be
                    associated with a very small increased risk of intussusception within seven days of vaccination, possibly two cases per 100,000 first doses given, and the
                    Rotarix&#174; prescribing information includes this as a possible side effect. The benefits of vaccination in preventing the consequences of rotavirus
                    infection outweigh this small potential risk in young children. Because of the potential risk, and to reduce the likelihood of a temporal association with
                    rotavirus vaccine, the first dose of vaccine should not be given after 15 weeks of age.
                    <p/>

                    <p>
                    There is no evidence that Rotarix&#174; has a causal association with the development of Kawasaki disease (Soares-Weiser K et al., 2012).
