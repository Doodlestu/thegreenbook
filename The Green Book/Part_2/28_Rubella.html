                            Rubella is a mild disease caused by a togavirus. There may be a mild prodromal illness involving a low-grade fever, malaise, coryza and mild
                            conjunctivitis. Lymphadenopathy involving post-auricular and sub-occipital glands may precede the rash. The rash is usually transitory, erythematous and
                            mostly seen behind the ears and on the face and neck. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable as the rash may be fleeting and is not specific to rubella.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rubella is spread by droplet transmission. The incubation period is 14 to 21 days, with the majority of individuals developing a rash 14 to 17 days after
                            exposure. Individuals with rubella are infectious from one week before symptoms appear to four days after the onset of the rash.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Complications include thrombocytopaenia (the rate may be as high as one in 3000 infections) and post-infectious encephalitis (one in 6000 cases) (Lokletz
                            and Reynolds, 1965; Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004). In adults, arthritis and arthralgia may occasionally be seen after rubella infection; chronic arthritis
                            has rarely been reported (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004).

                            Maternal rubella infection in pregnancy may result in fetal loss or in congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). CRS presents with one or more of the following:

                        Infection in the first eight to ten weeks of pregnancy results in damage in up to 90% of surviving infants; multiple defects are common. The risk of damage
                        declines to about 10 to 20% with infection occurring between 11 and 16 weeks gestation (Miller <em>et al</em>., 1982). Fetal damage is rare with infection
                        after 16 weeks of pregnancy, with only deafness being reported following infections up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. Some infected infants may appear normal at
                        birth but perceptive deafness may be detected later (Miller <em>et al</em>., 1982; Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004).

                    <p>
                        Before the introduction of rubella immunisation, rubella occurred commonly in children, and more than 80% of adults had evidence of previous rubella
                        infection (Morgan Capner <em>et al</em>., 1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rubella immunisation was introduced in the UK in 1970 for pre-pubertal girls and non-immune women of childbearing age to prevent rubella infection in
                        pregnancy. Rather than interrupting the circulation of rubella, the aim of this strategy was to directly protect women of childbearing age by increasing
                        the proportion with antibody to rubella; this increased from 85 to 90% before 1970 to 97 to 98% by 1987 (Vyse <em>et al.</em>, 2002). Surveillance for
                        congenital rubella was established in 1971 to monitor the impact of the vaccination programme. During the period 1971-75 there were an average of 48 CRS
                        births and 742 terminations annually in the UK (Tookey and Peckham, 1999) (see Figure 28.1).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the selective immunisation policy was effective in reducing the number of cases of CRS and terminations of pregnancy, cases of rubella in
                        pregnancy continued to occur. This was mainly because the few women who remained susceptible to rubella could still acquire rubella infection from their
                        own and/or their friends' children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Universal immunisation against rubella, using the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, was introduced in October 1988. The aim of this policy was to
                        interrupt circulation of rubella among young children, thereby protecting susceptible adult women from exposure. At the same time, rubella was made a
                        notifiable disease. A considerable decline in rubella in young children followed the introduction of MMR, with a concomitant fall in rubella infections in
                        pregnant women - from 167 in 1987 to one in 2003.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A seroprevalence study in 1989 showed a high rate of rubella susceptibility in school-age children, particularly in males (Miller <em>et al.</em>, 1991).
                        In 1993, there was a large increase in both notifications and laboratory-confirmed cases of rubella. Many of the individuals affected would not have been
                        eligible for MMR or for the rubella vaccine. For this reason, the combined measles-rubella (MR) vaccine was used for the schools campaign in November 1994
                        (see Chapter

                        21). At that time, insufficient stocks of MMR were available to vaccinate all of these children against mumps. Over 8 million children aged between 5 and
                        16 years were immunised with the MR vaccine.

                        In October 1996, a two-dose MMR schedule was introduced and the selective vaccination policy of teenage girls ceased. A single dose of rubella-containing
                        vaccine as used in the UK confers around 95 to 100% protection against rubella (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004).

                    <p>
                        In Finland, a two-dose MMR schedule was introduced in 1982; high coverage of each dose has been achieved consistently. Indigenous measles, mumps and
                        rubella have been eliminated since 1994 (Peltola <em>et al.</em>, 1994). The United States introduced its two-dose schedule in 1989 and, in 2000, announced
                        that it had interrupted endemic transmission (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004, Chapter 20). MMR is now routinely given in over 100 countries, including those
                        in the European Union, North America and Australasia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A further resurgence of rubella was observed in the UK in 1996. Many of these cases occurred in colleges and universities in males who had already left
                        school before the 1994 MR campaign (Vyse <em>et al.</em>, 2002). Sporadic rubella cases have been reported since then, mainly linked to imported cases
                        (Health Protection Agency website).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since 1991, only around one-third of CRS infants have been born to UK-born women who acquired infection in the UK. The remaining two-thirds of CRS infants
                        were born to women who were themselves born overseas. Of these, around one-half acquired infection overseas, mostly during early pregnancy, in their
                        country of origin. The remaining women acquired infection in the UK, usually within two years of arrival (Rahi <em>et al</em>., 2001; Tookey and Peckham,
                        1999; Tookey <em>et al</em>., 2002; Tookey, 2004). This latter observation is explained by higher susceptibility rates among some minority ethnic groups in
                        the UK who had not been infected or immunised before coming to this country (Tookey <em>et al</em>., 2002).

                        The unreconstituted vaccine and its diluent should be stored in the original packaging at +2&#730;C to +8&#730;C and protected from light. All vaccines are
                        sensitive to some extent to heat and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be
                        guaranteed for vaccines unless they have been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some
                        vaccines. It can also cause hairline cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.

                        be given by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MMR vaccine can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as DTaP/ IPV, Hib/MenC and hepatitis B. The vaccine should be given at a separate site,
                        preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003). See chapter 11
                        for the routine childhood immunisation schedule. If MMR cannot be given at the same time as an inactivated vaccine, it can be given at any interval before
                        or after. The site at which each vaccine is given should be noted in the child's record.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MMR should ideally be given at the same time as other live vaccines, such as BCG. If live vaccines are given simultaneously, then each vaccine virus will
                        begin to replicate and an appropriate immune response is made to each vaccine. After a live vaccine is given, natural interferon is produced in response to
                        that vaccine. If a second live vaccine is given during this response, the interferon may prevent replication of the second vaccine virus. This may
                        attenuate the response to the second vaccine. Based on evidence that MMR vaccine can lead to an attenuation of the varicella vaccine response (Mullooly and
                        Black, 2001), the recommended interval between live vaccines is currently four weeks. For this reason, if live vaccines cannot be administered
                        simultaneously, a four-week interval is recommended.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Four weeks should be left between giving MMR vaccine and carrying out tuberculin testing. The measles vaccine component of MMR can reduce the delayed-type
                        hypersensitivity response. As this is the basis of a positive tuberculin test, this could give a false negative response.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When MMR is given within three months of receiving blood products, such as immunoglobulin, the response to the measles component may be reduced. This is
                        because such blood products may contain significant levels of measles- specific antibody, which could then prevent vaccine virus replication. Where
                        possible, MMR should be deferred until three months after receipt of such products. If immediate measles protection is required in someone who has recently
                        received a blood product, MMR vaccine should still be given. To confer longer-term protection, MMR should be repeated after three months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where rubella protection is required for post-partum women who have received anti-D immunoglobulin, no deferral is necessary as the response to the rubella
                        component is normally adequate (Edgar and Hambling, 1977; Black <em>et al</em>., 1983). Blood transfusion around the time of delivery may inhibit the
                        rubella response and, therefore, a test for rubella antibody should be undertaken six to eight weeks after vaccination. The vaccination should be repeated
                        if necessary.

                        The objective of the immunisation programme is to provide two doses of MMR vaccine at appropriate intervals for all eligible individuals.

                    <p>
                        Over 90% of individuals will seroconvert to measles, mumps and rubella antibodies after the first dose of the MMR vaccines currently used in the UK
                        (Tischer and Gerike, 2000). Antibody responses from pre-licence studies may be higher, however, than clinical protection under routine use. Evidence shows
                        that a single dose of measles-containing vaccine confers protection in around 90% of individuals for measles (Morse <em>et al</em>., 1994; Medical Research
                        Council, 1977). A single dose of a rubella-containing vaccine confers around 95 to 100% protection (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004). A single dose of a
                        mumpscontaining vaccine used in the UK confers between 61% and 91% protection against mumps (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004). A more recent study in the UK
                        suggested that a single dose of MMR is around 64% effective against mumps (Harling <em>et al.</em>, 2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, two doses of MMR are required to produce satisfactory protection against measles, mumps and rubella.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MMR is recommended when protection against measles, mumps and/or rubella is required. MMR vaccine can be given irrespective of a history of measles, mumps
                        or rubella infection. There are no ill effects from immunising such individuals because they have pre-existing immunity that inhibits replication of the
                        vaccine viruses.

                    <p>
                        The first dose of MMR should be given between 12 and 13 months of age (i.e. within a month of the first birthday). Immunisation before one year of age
                        provides earlier protection in localities where the risk of measles is higher, but residual maternal antibodies may reduce the response rate to the
                        vaccine. The optimal age chosen for scheduling children is therefore a compromise between risk of disease and level of protection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a dose of MMR is given before the first birthday, either because of travel to an endemic country, or because of a local outbreak, then this dose should
                        be ignored, and two further doses given at the recommended times between 12 and 13 months of age (i.e. within a month of the first birthday) and at three
                        years four months to five years of age (see chapter 11).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A second dose is normally given before school entry but can be given routinely at any time from three months after the first dose. Allowing three months
                        between doses is likely to maximise the response rate, particularly in young children under the age of 18 months where maternal antibodies may reduce the
                        response to vaccination (Orenstein <em>et al.</em>, 1986; Redd <em>et al</em>., 2004; de Serres <em>et al</em>., 1995). Where protection against measles is
                        urgently required, the second dose can be given one month after the first (ACIP, 1998). If the child is given the second dose less than three months after
                        the first dose and at less than 18 months of age, then the routine pre-school dose (a third dose) should be given in order to ensure full protection.

                        All children should have received two doses of MMR vaccine before they leave school. The teenage (school-leaving) booster session or appointment is an
                        opportunity to ensure that unimmunised or partially immunised children are given MMR. If two doses of MMR are required, then the second dose should be
                        given one month after the first.

                        MMR vaccine can be given to individuals of any age.<strong> </strong>Entry into college, university or other higher education institutions, prison or
                        military service provides an opportunity to check an individual's immunisation history. Those who have not received MMR should be offered appropriate MMR

                        All seronegative women of childbearing age who need to be protected against rubella should be offered MMR vaccine. Satisfactory evidence of protection

                        The decision on when to vaccinate other adults needs to take into consideration the past vaccination history, the likelihood of an individual remaining

                        Anaphylaxis after MMR is extremely rare (3.5 to 14.4 per million doses) (Bohlke <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Patja <em>et al</em>., 2000; Pool <em>et al</em>.,
                        2002; D'Souza <em>et al</em>., 2000). Minor allergic conditions may occur and are not contraindications to further immunisation with MMR or other vaccines.
                        A careful history of that event will often distinguish between anaphylaxis and other events that are either not due to the vaccine or are not
                        life-threatening. In the latter circumstances, it may be possible to continue the immunisation course. Specialist advice must be sought on the vaccines and
                        circumstances in which they could be given. The lifelong risk to the individual of not being immunised must be taken into account.

                        Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation should be
                        postponed until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any sign or
                        symptoms to the adverse effects of the vaccine.

                    <p>
                        MMR vaccination, usually within six weeks of the first dose. The risk of developing ITP after MMR vaccine is much less than the risk of developing it after
                        infection with wild measles or rubella virus.

                    <p>
                        If ITP has occurred within six weeks of the first dose of MMR, then blood should be taken and tested for measles, mumps and rubella antibodies before a
                        second dose is given. Serum should be sent to the Health Protection Agency (HPA) Virus Reference Laboratory (Colindale), which offers free, specialised
                        serological testing for such children. If the results suggest incomplete immunity against measles, mumps or rubella, then a second dose of MMR is
                        recommended.

                        All children with egg allergy should receive the MMR vaccination as a routine procedure in primary care (Clark <em>et al.,</em> 2010). Recent data suggest
                        that anaphylactic reactions to MMR vaccine are not associated with hypersensitivity to egg antigens but to other components of the vaccine (such as
                        gelatin) (Fox and Lack, 2003). In three large studies with a combined total of over 1000 patients with egg allergy, no severe cardiorespiratory reactions
                        were reported after MMR vaccination (Fasano <em>et al.,</em> 1992; Freigang <em>et al.,</em> 1994; Aickin <em>et al.,</em> 1994; Khakoo and Lack, 2000).
                        Children who have had documented anaphylaxis to the vaccine itself should be assessed by an allergist (Clark <em>et al.,</em> 2010).

                        There is no evidence that rubella-containing vaccines are teratogenic. In the USA, UK and Germany, 661 women were followed through active surveillance,
                        including 293 who were vaccinated (mainly with single rubella vaccine) in the high-risk period (i.e. the six weeks after the last menstrual period). Only
                        16 infants had evidence of infection and none had permanent abnormalities compatible with CRS (Best <em>et al.</em>, 2004). However, as a precaution, MMR
                        vaccine should not be given to women known to be pregnant. If MMR vaccine is given to adult women, they should be advised to guard against pregnancy for
                        one month.

                        Termination of pregnancy following inadvertent immunisation should not be recommended (Tookey <em>et al</em>., 1991). The potential parents should be given
                        information on the evidence of lack of risk from vaccination in pregnancy. Surveillance of inadvertent MMR administration in pregnancy is being conducted
                        by the HPA Immunisation Department, to whom such cases should be reported (Tel: 020 8200 4400).

                    <p>
                        Pregnant women who are found to be susceptible to rubella should be immunised with MMR after delivery.

                        Breast-feeding is not a contraindication to MMR immunisation, and MMR vaccine can be given to breast-feeding mothers without any risk to their baby. Very
                        occasionally, rubella vaccine virus has been found in breast milk, but this has not caused any symptoms in the baby (Buimovici-Klein <em>et al.,</em> 1997;
                        Landes <em>et al</em>., 1980; Losonsky <em>et al</em>., 1982). The vaccine does not work when taken orally. There is no evidence of mumps and measles
                        vaccine viruses being found in breast milk.

                        specialist paediatric advice rather than refuse immunisation.

                        Adverse reactions following the MMR vaccine (except allergic reactions) are due to effective replication of the vaccine viruses with subsequent mild
                        illness. Such events are to be expected in some individuals. Events due to the measles component occur six to 11 days after vaccination. Events due to the
                        mumps and rubella components usually occur two to three weeks after vaccination but may occur up to six weeks after vaccination. These events only occur in
                        individuals who are susceptible to that component, and are therefore less common after second and subsequent doses. Individuals with vaccine- associated
                        symptoms are not infectious to others.

                        Following the first dose of MMR vaccine, malaise, fever and/or a rash may occur, most commonly about a week after immunisation, and last about two to three
                        days. In a study of over 6000 children aged one to two years, the symptoms reported were similar in nature, frequency, time of onset and duration to those
                        commonly reported after measles vaccine alone (Miller <em>et al</em>., 1989). Parotid swelling occurred in about 1% of children of all ages up to four
                        years, usually in the third week.

                        Adverse reactions are considerably less common after a second dose of MMR vaccine than after the first dose. One study showed no increase in fever or rash
                        after re-immunisation of college students compared with unimmunised controls (Chen <em>et al</em>., 1991). An analysis of allergic reactions reported
                        through the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System in 1991-93 showed fewer reactions among children aged six to 19 years, considered to be second-dose
                        recipients, than among those aged one to four years, considered to be first-dose recipients (Chen <em>et al</em>., 1991). In a study of over 8000 children
                        there was no increased risk of convulsions, rash or joint pain in the months after the second dose of the MMR vaccination given between four and six years
                        of age (Davis <em>et al</em>., 1997).

                        Febrile seizures are the most commonly reported neurological event following measles immunisation. Seizures occur during the sixth to eleventh day in one
                        in 1000 children vaccinated with MMR - a rate similar to that reported in the same period after measles vaccine. The rate of febrile seizures following MMR
                        is lower than that following infection with measles disease (Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004). There is good evidence that febrile seizures following MMR
                        immunisation do not increase the risk of subsequent epilepsy compared with febrile seizures due to other causes (Vestergaard <em>et al</em>., 2004).

                        One strain of mumps virus (Urabe) in an MMR vaccine previously used in the UK was associated with an increased risk of aseptic meningitis (Miller <em>et al</em>., 1993). This vaccine was replaced in 1992 (Department of Health, 1992) and is no longer licensed in the UK. A study in Finland using MMR
                        containing a different mumps strain (Jeryl Lynn), similar to those used currently in MMR in the UK, did not identify any association between MMR and
                        aseptic meningitis (Makela <em>et al.</em>, 2002).

                        Because MMR vaccine contains live, attenuated viruses, it is biologically plausible that it may cause encephalitis. A recent large record linkage study in
                        Finland looking at over half a million children aged between one and seven years did not identify any association between MMR and encephalitis (Makela <em>et al</em>., 2002).

                        ITP is a condition that may occur following MMR and is most likely due to the rubella component. This usually occurs within six weeks and resolves
                        spontaneously. ITP occurs in about one in 22,300 children given a first dose of MMR in the second year of life (Miller <em>et</em> <em>al.,</em> 2001). If
                        ITP has occurred within six weeks of the first dose of MMR, then blood should be taken and tested for measles, mumps and rubella antibodies before a second
                        dose is given (see above).

                        Arthropathy (arthralgia or arthritis) has also been reported to occur rarely after MMR immunisation, probably due to the rubella component. If it is caused
                        by the vaccine, it should occur between 14 and 21 days after immunisation. Where it occurs at other times, it is highly unlikely to have been caused by
                        vaccination. Several controlled epidemiological studies have shown no excess risk of chronic arthritis in women (Slater, 1997).

                        All suspected adverse reactions to vaccines occurring in children, or in individuals of any age after vaccines labelled with a black triangle (&#9660;),
                        should be reported to the Commission on Human Medicines using the Yellow Card scheme. Serious, suspected adverse reactions to vaccines in adults should be
                        reported through the Yellow Card scheme.

                        Following the November 1994 MR immunisation campaign, only three cases of Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome (GBS) were reported. From the background rate,
                        between one and eight cases would have been expected in this population over this period. Therefore, it is likely that these three cases were coincidental
                        and not caused by the vaccine. Analysis of reporting rates of GBS from acute flaccid paralysis surveillance undertaken in the WHO Region of the Americas
                        has shown no increase in rates of GBS following measles immunisation campaigns when 80 million children were immunised (da Silveira <em>et al</em>., 1997).
                        In a population that received 900,000 doses of MMR, there was no increased risk of GBS at any time after vaccinations (Patja <em>et al</em>., 2001). This
                        evidence refutes the suggestion that MMR causes GBS.

                        In recent years, the postulated link between measles vaccine and bowel disease has been investigated. There was no increase in the incidence of
                        inflammatory bowel disorders in those vaccinated with measles-containing vaccines compared with controls (Gilat <em>et al</em>., 1987; Feeney <em>et al</em>., 1997). No increase in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease has been observed since the introduction of MMR vaccination in Finland
                        (Pebody <em>et al</em>., 1998) or in the UK (Seagroatt, 2005).

                        It has been suggested that combined MMR vaccine could potentially overload the immune system. From the moment of birth, humans are exposed to countless
                        numbers of foreign antigens and infectious agents in their everyday environment. Responding to the three viruses in MMR would use only a tiny proportion of
                        the total capacity of an infant's immune system (Offit <em>et al</em>., 2002). The three viruses in MMR replicate at different rates from each other and
                        would be expected to reach high levels at different times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A study examining the issue of immunological overload found a lower rate of admission for serious bacterial infection in the period shortly after MMR
                        vaccination compared with other time periods. This suggests that MMR does not cause any general suppression of the immune system (Miller <em>et al</em>.,
                        2003).

                        Prompt notification of measles, mumps and rubella to the local health protection unit (HPU) is required to ensure public health action can be taken
                        promptly. Notification should be based on clinical suspicion and should not await laboratory confirmation. Since 1994, few clinically diagnosed cases are
                        subsequently confirmed to be true measles, mumps or rubella. Confirmation rates do increase, however, during outbreaks and epidemics.

                    <p>
                        The diagnosis of measles, mumps and rubella can be confirmed through non-invasive means. Detection of specific IgM in oral fluid (saliva) samples, ideally
                        between one and six weeks after the onset of rash or parotid swelling, has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific for confirmation of these
                        infections (Brown <em>et al</em>., 1994; Ramsay <em>et al</em>., 1991; Ramsay <em>et al</em>., 1998). It is recommended that oral fluid samples should be
                        obtained from all notified cases, other than during a large epidemic. Advice on this procedure can be obtained from the local HPU.

                    <p>
                        Antibody response to the rubella component of MMR vaccine does not develop soon enough to provide effective prophylaxis after exposure to suspected
                        rubella. Even where it is too late to provide effective post-exposure prophylaxis with MMR, the vaccine can provide protection against future exposure to
                        all three infections. Therefore, contact with suspected measles, mumps or rubella provides a good opportunity to offer MMR vaccine to previously
                        unvaccinated individuals. If the individual is already incubating measles, mumps or rubella, MMR vaccination will not exacerbate the symptoms. In these
                        circumstances, individuals should be advised that a rubella-like illness occurring shortly after vaccination is likely to be due to natural infection. If
                        there is doubt about an individual's vaccination status, MMR should still be given as there are no ill effects from vaccinating those who are already
                        immune.
