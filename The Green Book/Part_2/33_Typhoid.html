                        <p>
                            Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by the gram-negative bacterium <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, subspecies <i>enterica</i>, serotype <i>typhi</i>. Paratyphoid fever is an illness clinically similar but usually less severe than typhoid and is caused by S. paratyphi A, B and C.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Following ingestion of contaminated food or water, <i>S. typhi</i> penetrates the intestinal mucosa, replicates and enters the bloodstream. The severity of symptoms varies. Clinical features range from mild fever, diarrhoea, myalgia and headache to severe disseminated disease with multi-organ involvement in 10 to 15% of cases. The case-fatality rate (CFR) is less than 1% with prompt antibiotic therapy, but may be as high as 20% in untreated cases. Typhoid has previously been thought to be a milder disease in children. Recent information, however, indicates that typhoid can cause significant morbidity in children aged one to five years who reside in endemic countries (Sinha <i>et al</i>., 1999).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unlike other <i>Salmonella</i> species, both <i>S. typhi</i> and <i>S. paratyphi</i> only colonise humans. Most of the more than 2000 other serotypes of <i>Salmonella</i> cause only local infection of the gastro-intestinal tract (gastroenteritis or &#145;food poisoning&#146;) and are commonly found in many mammalian hosts.
                        </p>
                        <p>Transmission is primarily via the oral route following ingestion of food or water contaminated by faeces and occasionally the urine of persons acutely ill with typhoid or those who are chronic carriers. Direct faecal-oral transmission can also occur. In healthy individuals, one million or more organisms may be required to cause illness; however, ingestion of fewer organisms may still result in illness, especially in susceptible individuals. The incubation period varies from one to three weeks, depending on host factors and the size of the infecting dose (Glynn and Bradley, 1992). </p>
                        <p>
                            The risk of contracting typhoid fever is highest for travellers to areas of high endemicity. In the Indian subcontinent, a region of high incidence of typhoid fever (more than 100 cases per 100,000 people per year (Crump <i>et al</i>., 2004)), the attack rate for travellers has been estimated at 1 to 10 per 100,000 journeys (Mermin <i>et al</i>., 1998; Steinberg <i>et al</i>., 2004; Connor and Schwartz, 2005).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All patients with typhoid and paratyphoid excrete the organisms at some stage during their illness. About 10% of patients with typhoid excrete <i>S. typhi</i> for at least three months following the acute illness, and 2 to 5% become long-term carriers (more than one year). The likelihood of becoming a chronic carrier increases with age, especially in females and those with a biliary tract abnormality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Typhoid can be successfully treated with antibiotic therapy and general medical support. Strains of <i>S. typhi</i> have become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, particularly in South Asia (Threlfall and Ward, 2001). This has implications for the treatment of typhoid fever as traditional antibiotic therapy (chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and amoxycillin) may not be effective. Treatment is usually with fluoroquinolones; third-generation cephalosporins or azithromycin may need to be given in resistant cases.
                        </p>
                        <p>Following natural infection with typhoid, an immune response develops that may partially protect against reinfection and severity of disease (WHO, 2000). </p>
                        <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>
                        <p>Typhoid is predominantly a disease of countries with inadequate sanitation and poor standards of personal and food hygiene. The disease is endemic in South Asia and parts of South-East Asia, the Middle East, Central and South America, and Africa. Outbreaks of typhoid have been reported from countries in Eastern Europe (Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Russia). In 2000, the global annual incidence of typhoid fever was estimated to be around 21.7 million cases with 216,510 deaths per year (CFR 1%) (Crump, Luby and Mintz, 2004). </p>
                        <p>
                            Typhoid is rare in resource-rich countries where standards of sanitation are high. Typhoid and paratyphoid in England and Wales are usually imported diseases associated with foreign travel or contact with somebody who has travelled. Between 1990 and 2004, there were an average of 374 laboratory reports of typhoid and paratyphoid each year in England and Wales, nearly 70% of which reported recent foreign travel (HPA, 2005). Annually, cases of <i>S. typhi</i> have traditionally exceeded cases of <i>S. paratyphi</i> A and B. However, beginning in 1997, more cases of <i>S. paratyphi</i> A and B have occurred in each year except 2000.
                        </p>
                        <p>The most frequently reported region of foreign travel for typhoid and paratyphoid A was South Asia; the Mediterranean and the Middle East were the most frequently reported regions for paratyphoid B (HPA, 2004). Occasional outbreaks of indigenous typhoid occur in the UK; the last community outbreak was in 2001 in Newport, Wales and involved five cases (Public Health Laboratory Services, 2001).</p>
                        <p>Prevention of typhoid and paratyphoid depends primarily on improving sanitation and water supplies in endemic areas and on scrupulous personal, food and water hygiene. Immunisation may be considered for individuals at risk from typhoid fever. There is no vaccine available to prevent paratyphoid infection. </p>

                    <p>Worldwide, three types of typhoid vaccine are available: a polysaccharide vaccine; an oral, live, attenuated vaccine; and a whole-cell inactivated vaccine. </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Vi polysaccharide vaccine</div>
                    <p>
                        One of the typhoid vaccines available in the UK is composed of purified Vi capsular polysaccharide from <i>S. typhi</i>. Each 0.5ml dose contains 25&#181;g of antigen. A four-fold rise in antibody against Vi antigen has been detected seven days following primary immunisation with Vi vaccine. Maximum antibody response is achieved one month following vaccination and persists for about three years (Keitel <i>et al</i>., 1994; Tacket <i>et al</i>., 1998).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The efficacy of the Vi vaccine was evaluated in field trials in Nepal (Acharya <i>et al</i>., 1987) and in Eastern Transvaal, South Africa (Klugman <i>et al</i>., 1987; Klugman <i>et al</i>., 1996). In the Nepalese study, vaccine efficacy at 20 months against culture-positive typhoid was 75% (95% CI = 49 to 87%) in adults and children aged five to 44 years. The South African study found the cumulative three-year efficacy of vaccine against culture-positive typhoid to be 55% (95% CI = 30 to 71%) in children aged six to 15 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Protective antibody titres to Vi antigen fall over time. Re-vaccination is necessary when continuing protection is required. Additional doses of Vi vaccine do not boost serum antibody levels; re-vaccination returns antibody levels to those achieved after the primary immunisation (Keitel <i>et al</i>., 1994).
                    </p>
                    <p>Non-conjugated polysaccharide vaccines are poorly immunogenic in infants and young children. There is little definitive data on the efficacy of Vi vaccine in children aged less than 18 months (Cadoz, 1998).</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, in 2008, the lower age limit for Typhim Vi was increased from 18 months to two years. </p>
                    <p>Protection by vaccination may be less if a large number of infective organisms are ingested. Because of the limited protection offered by the vaccine, the importance of scrupulous attention to personal, food and water hygiene must still be emphasised for those travelling to endemic areas.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Oral typhoid vaccine (Ty21a)</div>
                    <p>
                        Oral typhoid vaccine contains a live, attenuated strain of <i>S. typhi</i> (Ty21a) in an enteric-coated capsule. A three-dose regimen gives a cumulative three-year efficacy of about 50 to 60% (Engels <i>et al</i>., 1998). The vaccine is indicated for persons from six years of age.
                    </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Whole-cell typhoid vaccine</div>
                    <p>
                        The injectable, killed, whole-cell typhoid vaccine contains heat-inactivated, phenol-preserved <i>S. typhi</i> organisms. A two-dose regimen gives a cumulative three-year efficacy of about 70%, and provides protection for up to five years (Engels <i>et al</i>., 1998). This vaccine is highly reactogenic and is no longer used in the UK.
                    </p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>
                    <p>Both Vi polysaccharide and oral typhoid (Ty21a) vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&#730;C to +8&#730;C and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless they have been stored at the correct temperature. If Vi vaccines have been frozen they should not be used as this can reduce their potency and increase local reactions. If a blister containing Ty21a vaccine capsules is not intact, it should not be used.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Presentation</div>
                    <p>Vi vaccines are supplied in pre-filled syringes, each containing a single dose of 0.5ml. Vaccines are available as a single antigen product or combined with hepatitis A vaccine. </p>
                    <p>Ty21a vaccines are supplied in blister packs containing three capsules.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Dosage and schedule</div>
                    <div id="fourthtitle">Vi vaccine</div>
                    <p>A single dose of 0.5ml of Vi vaccine is recommended for adults and children over the age of two years.</p>
                    <div id="fourthtitle">Ty21a vaccine</div>
                    <p>The first Ty21a capsule is taken on day 0, the second capsule on day 2 and the third on day 4. The vaccine is recommended for children over the age of six years and adults. Reinforcing doses of three capsules should be given as recommended.</p>

Capsules should be taken about one hour before a meal with a cold or lukewarm drink (temperature not to exceed  37&#730;C).

                    <p>Unless the immunisation schedule of three vaccine capsules is completed, an optimal immune response may not be achieved. Protection commences about seven to ten days after completion of the third dose.</p>
                    <p>Not all recipients of typhoid vaccines will be protected against typhoid fever, and travellers should be advised to take all necessary precautions to avoid contact with or ingestion of potentially contaminated food or water.</p>

                    <p>Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation should be postponed until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any sign or symptoms to the adverse effects of the vaccine.</p>
                    <p>In the event of a gastrointestinal illness, vaccination with the Ty21a vaccine should be postponed until after recovery. Ty21a vaccine should not be commenced within three days of completing any antibacterial agents, and similarly, antibacterial therapy should not commence within three days after the last dose of vaccine.</p>
                    <p>If malaria prophylaxis is also required, the fixed combination of atovaquone and proguanil can be given concomitantly with Ty21a.

                        Based on pooled estimates from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data, local reactions (pain, swelling, erythema and induration at injection site) are the most commonly reported symptoms following Vi vaccine (Engels <i>et al</i>., 1998; Tacket <i>et al</i>., 1986; Begier <i>et al</i>., 2004). These symptoms are usually mild and transient. Systemic reactions following the vaccine are infrequent. Fever occurs in about 1% of vaccine recipients. Headache, nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pain have been reported but are uncommon.
