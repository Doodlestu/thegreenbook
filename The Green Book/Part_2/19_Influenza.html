                    <p>
                        Influenza is an acute viral infection of the respiratory tract. There are three types of influenza virus: A, B and C. Influenza A and influenza B are
                        responsible for most clinical illness. Influenza is highly infectious with a usual incubation period of one to three days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The disease is characterised by the sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, myalgia and extreme fatigue. Other common symptoms include a dry cough, sore
                        throat and stuffy nose. For otherwise healthy individuals, influenza is an unpleasant but usually self-limiting disease with recovery usually within two to
                        seven days. The illness may be complicated by (and may present as) bronchitis, secondary bacterial pneumonia or, in children, otitis media. Influenza can
                        be complicated more unusually by meningitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The risk of serious illness from influenza is higher amongst children
                        under six months of age (Poehling <em>et al</em>., 2006; Ampofo <em>et al</em>., 2006; Coffin <em>et al</em>., 2007; Zhou <em>et al</em>, 2012), older
                        people (Thompson <em>et al</em>., 2003 and 2004; Zhou <em>et al</em>, 2012) and those with underlying health conditions such as respiratory or cardiac
                        disease, chronic neurological conditions, or immunosuppression and pregnant women (Neuzil <em>et al</em>., 1998; O'Brien <em>et al</em>., 2004; Nicoll <em>et al</em>., 2008 and Pebody <em>et al</em>., 2010). Influenza during pregnancy may also be associated with perinatal mortality, prematurity, smaller
                        neonatal size and lower birth weight (Pierce <em>et al</em>., 2011; Mendez-Figueroa <em>et al</em>., 2011).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although primary influenza pneumonia is a rare
                        complication that may occur at any age and carries a high case fatality rate (Barker and Mullooly, 1982), it was seen more frequently during the 2009
                        pandemic and the following influenza season. Serological studies in healthcare professionals have shown that approximately 30 to 50% of influenza
                        infections can be asymptomatic (Wilde <em>et al</em>., 1999) but the proportion of influenza infections that are asymptomatic may vary depending on the
                        characteristics of the influenza strain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transmission is by droplets, aerosol, or through direct contact with respiratory secretions of someone with the infection (Lau <em>et al</em>., 2010).
                        Influenza spreads rapidly, especially in closed communities. Most cases in the UK tend to occur during an eight- to ten-week period during the winter. The
                        timing, extent and severity of this 'seasonal' influenza can all vary. Influenza A viruses cause outbreaks most years and it is these viruses that are the
                        usual cause of epidemics. Large epidemics occur intermittently. Influenza B tends to cause less severe disease and smaller outbreaks overall.
                    </p>
                    <p>The burden of influenza B disease is mostly in children when the severity of illness can be similar to that associated with influenza A. </p>
                    <p>
                        Changes in the principal surface antigens of influenza A - haemagglutinin and neuraminidase - make these viruses antigenically labile. Minor changes
                        described as antigenic drift occur progressively from season to season. Antigenic shift occurs periodically, resulting in major changes and the emergence
                        of a new subtype with a different haemagglutinin protein. Because immunity from the previous virus may not protect completely against the new subtype, the
                        population may have little or no immunity, and this may therefore lead to widespread epidemics or even a pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three influenza pandemics occurred in the last century (in 1918, 1957 and 1968). The first influenza pandemic of this century was declared by the World
                        Health Organization (WHO) in June 2009. This was caused by an influenza A(H1N1)v virus. The influenza A(H1N1)v pandemic caused higher rates of illness in
                        children and young adults and lower rates of illness in adults aged 60 years and older when compared with 'seasonal' influenza (Writing Committee of the
                        WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza, 2010).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For most individuals, the disease was mild. Symptoms were similar to those
                        of 'seasonal' influenza, although gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhoea) were more commonly reported than is usual for 'seasonal' influenza.
                        During the pandemic, there were fewer than 500 laboratory confirmed deaths from influenza A(H1N1)v in the UK with an overall estimated case fatality ratio
                        of 0.25 per 1000 clinical cases (95% confidence limits 0.13 to 0.4 per 1000 clinical cases) (Presanis, <em>et al</em>

                        ., 2011). The highest mortality rates were in those with chronic neurological disease, respiratory disease and immunosuppression (Pebody <em>et al</em>

                        ., 2010). Pregnant women were also at increased risk of complications (Jamison <em>et al</em>

                        ., 2009). Most of the serious complications
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        arising from influenza A(H1N1)v infection occurred in people with underlying health conditions, but a significant proportion arose in people who had been
                        previously healthy (Writing Committee of the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza, 2010).

                        showing the variation in the timing and shape of influenza activity usually between weeks 37 and 15. However, much of the influenza A(H1N1)v pandemic
                        activity was outside that usual time window, demonstrated by the non-seasonal peak at week 29 in 2009/10. Data for 2009/10 may underestimate the extent of
                        influenza-like illness due to the introduction of the National Pandemic Flu Service in England during 2009. There may be differences in the epidemiology of
                        influenza between the different countries in the UK. Data provided by PHE (formerly HPA) and RCGP.

                        The influenza A(H1N1)v strain continued to cause widespread illness during the 2010/11 influenza season. Despite the recent emergence of the influenza
                        A(H1N1)v strain, conditions still exist for the emergence of future influenza strains with potential to lead to another pandemic (for example, from
                        influenza A H5N1 or H7N9 strains).

                        Influenza B viruses are also subject to antigenic drift but with less frequent changes.

                        Influenza activity is monitored in the UK through a variety of schemes based in primary and secondary care. One important indicator is based on reports of
                        new consultations for influenza-like illness from sentinel GP practices, combined with virological surveillance. Weekly reports are collated by Public
                        Health England (PHE, formerly Health Protection Agency (HPA)).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additional information for England is provided by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), for Scotland by Health Protection Scotland, for Wales
                        by Public Health Wales and for Northern Ireland by the Public Health Agency.

                    <p>
                        Official estimates of the number of deaths attributable to influenza are produced by PHE. These are inferred from the number of all-cause death
                        registrations in the winter period that are above an expected seasonal level. However, as the cause of deaths is not examined directly, deaths above the
                        expected level may include causes other than influenza such as cold weather related conditions. Estimates of excess winter deaths potentially attributable
                        to influenza in years in the last decade in England and Wales range from not determined (in 2005-6 and 2006-7) to 10,351 (in 2008-9). The highest estimate
                        in the past two decades was 21,497 for the 1999-2000 influenza season (Donaldson <em>et al</em>., 2010).

                    <p>
                        PHE also collects data on admissions to intensive care units and on deaths with a laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Whilst it is not possible to
                        ascertain all fatal cases where influenza was involved, investigation of such cases allows assessment of the characteristics of people most severely
                        affected by influenza, including age and the responsible influenza type. An analysis by PHE of data from fatal cases collected in England during the
                        2010/11 influenza season, when influenza A(H1N1)v was the predominant circulating strain, gives an indication of the increased risk of death from influenza
                        complications for those in clinical risk groups (see Table 19.1).

                        Influenza immunisation has been recommended in the UK since the late 1960s, with the aim of directly protecting those in clinical risk groups who are at a
                        higher risk of influenza associated morbidity and mortality. In 2000, the policy was extended to include all people aged 65 years or over (see later for
                        age definition). In 2010, pregnancy was added as a clinical risk category for routine influenza immunisation. In 2012, the Joint Committee on Vaccination
                        and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended that the programme should be extended to all children aged two to 16 years. The phased introduction of this extension
                        began in 2013 with the inclusion of children aged two and three years in the routine programme (see later for age definition).

                        in the UK is shown in Table 19.2.

                        Because of the changing nature of influenza viruses, WHO monitors the epidemiology of influenza viruses throughout the world. Each year it makes
                        recommendations about the strains to be included in vaccines for the forthcoming winter for the northern and southern hemispheres
                        <p>
                            <a href="www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/">www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza</a>
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Influenza vaccines are prepared using virus strains in line with the WHO recommendations. Most current influenza vaccines are trivalent, containing two
                        subtypes of influenza A and one B virus. Quadrivalent vaccines with an additional B virus have been developed and the first authorised quadrivalent
                        influenza vaccine will be available for use in the UK in 2013. In most recent years, the vaccines have closely matched the influenza A viruses circulating
                        during the subsequent influenza season.
                    </p>
                    <p>If a new influenza A subtype were to emerge with epidemic or pandemic potential (as occurred in 2009 with influenza
                        A(H1N1)v), it is unlikely that the influenza vaccine will be well matched to the emerging strain. In these circumstances, as was done during the 2009
                        pandemic, a monovalent vaccine against that strain will be developed and implemented. However, because two lineages of B strain can circulate, and in some
                        seasons co-circulate, mismatches of the trivalent vaccine-type and the circulating B strain can occur more frequently. The use of quadrivalent influenza
                        vaccines containing a B strain from each lineage is expected to improve the matching of the vaccine to the circulating B strain(s). </p>
                    <p>
                        All authorised influenza vaccines need to meet immunogenicity, safety and quality criteria set by the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human
                        Use (CHMP), with the assessment of expected efficacy based on meeting or exceeding indicated requirements in serological assessments of immunogenicity
                        (EMA, 1997). A recent meta-analysis, which included studies when the influenza virus strains in the trivalent vaccine were drifted or mismatched with those
                        in circulation, suggested an overall effectiveness against confirmed disease of 59% (95% confidence interval 51-67) in adults aged 18 to 65 years
                        (Osterholm <em>et al</em>., 2012). In the elderly, protection produced by the vaccine may be lower (Fleming <em>et al</em>., 2010), although immunisation
                        has been shown to reduce the incidence of severe disease including bronchopneumonia, hospital admissions and mortality (Wright <em>et al</em>., 1977;
                        Mangtani <em>et al</em>., 2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine has been shown to provide a higher level of protection for children than
                        trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Belshe <em>et al</em>., 2007); a recent meta-analysis suggested an efficacy against confirmed disease of 83% (95%
                        confidence interval 69-91) (Osterholm <em>et al</em>., 2012; Ashkenazi <em>et al</em>., 2006; Fleming <em>et al</em>., 2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After immunisation, protective immune responses may be achieved within 14 days. Although influenza activity is not usually significant in the UK before the
                        middle of November, the influenza season can start early (as it did in 2003-04), and therefore the ideal time for immunisation is between September and
                        early November. Protection afforded by the vaccine is thought to last for at least one influenza season. However, as the level of protection provided in
                        subsequent seasons is likely to reduce and there may be changes to the circulating strains from one season to the next, annual revaccination is important.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Manufacture of influenza vaccines is complex and conducted to a tight schedule, constrained by the period between the announcement of the WHO
                        recommendations and the opportunity to vaccinate before the influenza season. Manufacturers may not be able to respond to unexpected demands for vaccine at
                        short notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All but one of the influenza vaccines available in the UK are inactivated and do not contain live viruses. One vaccine (Fluenz&reg;) contains live viruses
                        that have been attenuated (weakened) and adapted to cold so that they cannot replicate efficiently at body temperature. None of the influenza vaccines can
                        therefore cause clinical influenza in those that can be vaccinated. Most of the vaccines are administered by intramuscular injection, although one vaccine
                        (Intanza&#174;) is administered by the intradermal route and another (Fluenz&reg;) by nasal spray. Most of the vaccines are prepared from viruses grown in
                        embryonated hens eggs. The influenza vaccines available in the UK for the 2013/14 influenza season are listed in Table 19.6

                        Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&#176;C to +8&#176;C and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat
                        and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Efficacy, safety and quality may be adversely affected if
                        vaccines are not stored at the temperatures specified in the licence. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines and
                        can also cause hairline cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.

                        Some of the summaries of product characteristics (SPCs) for intramuscular inactivated influenza vaccines indicate that young children can be given either a
                        0.25ml or a 0.5ml dose. JCVI has advised that where these alternative doses are indicated in the SPC, the 0.5ml dose of intramuscular inactivated influenza
                        vaccine should be given to infants aged six months or older and young children because there is evidence that this dose is effective in young children
                        (Heinonen <em>et al</em>., 2010).

                        JCVI has advised that only children aged six months to under nine years who are in clinical risk groups and have not received influenza vaccine previously
                        or are being offered inactivated influenza vaccine for the first time should be offered a second dose of vaccine. All other children should receive a
                        single dose of influenza vaccine, including those receiving live attenuated influenza vaccine, irrespective of whether they have received influenza vaccine
                        previously. This advice differs from that in SPCs of influenza vaccines. Children who only received one dose of influenza vaccine or who only received the
                        pandemic monovalent influenza A(H1N1)v vaccine before should be considered as previously vaccinated (see later section on children).
                    </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Administration</div>
                    <p>
                        The inactivated influenza vaccines given by intramuscular injection should be given preferably into the upper arm (or anterolateral thigh in infants).
                        However, individuals with a bleeding disorder should be given vaccine by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inactivated influenza vaccine administered by the intradermal route (Intanza<sup>&#174;</sup>) is supplied in a micro-needle injection system that is
                        held at rightangles to the skin. The device allows intradermal vaccination to be performed without the need for additional training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The live attenuated influenza vaccine is administered by the intranasal route (Fluenz<sup>&#174;</sup>) and is supplied in an applicator that allows a
                        divided dose to be administered in each nostril (total dose of 0.2ml, 0.1ml in each nostril). The device allows intranasal administration to be performed
                        without the need for additional training. Administration of either dose does not need to be repeated if the patient sneezes or blows their nose following
                        administration. There are no data on the effectiveness of Fluenz&reg; when given to children with a heavily blocked or runny nose (rhinitis) attributable
                        to infection or allergy. As heavy nasal congestion might impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administration until
                        resolution of the nasal congestion or an appropriate alternative intramuscularly administered influenza vaccine should be considered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inactivated influenza vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines. The live attenuated vaccine can also be given at the same time as other
                        live or inactivated vaccines. It is normally recommended where vaccines cannot be administered simultaneously; a four-week interval should be observed
                        between live viral vaccines. There are no data on whether this advice applies to live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine. Where protection is needed
                        before the start of the expected seasonal increase in influenza activity, vaccination should not be delayed because of another recent live virus
                        vaccination, or vaccination with inactivated vaccine should be offered. Intramuscular and intradermal vaccines should be given at separate sites,
                        preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a wide variety of influenza vaccines are on the UK market each year, it is especially important that the exact brand of vaccine, batch number and site
                        at which each vaccine is given is accurately recorded in the patient records. Where the vaccine is given for occupational reasons, it is recommended that
                        the employer keep a vaccination record. It is important that vaccinations given either at a general practice or elsewhere (for example, at community
                        pharmacies, or antenatal clinics) are recorded on appropriate health records for the individual (using the appropriate clinical code) in a timely manner,
                        including the relevant Child Health Information System. If given elsewhere, a record of vaccination should be returned to the patient's general practice to
                        allow clinical follow up and to avoid duplicate vaccination.

                        <p>
                            Equipment used for vaccination, including used vials, ampoules, or partially discharged vials and syringes should be disposed of at the end of a session by sealing in a proper, puncture-resistant ‘sharps&#146 box according to local authority regulations and guidance in the technical memorandum 07-01 (Department of Health, 2006).

                        The objective of the influenza immunisation programme is to protect those who are most at risk of serious illness or death should they develop influenza
                        and to reduce transmission of the infection, thereby contributing to the protection of vulnerable patients who may have a suboptimal response to their own
                        immunisations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To facilitate this, general practitioners are required to proactively identify all those for whom influenza immunisations are indicated and to compile a
                        register of those patients for whom influenza immunisation is recommended. Sufficient vaccine can then be ordered in advance and patients can be invited to
                        planned immunisation sessions or appointments. Given that some influenza vaccines are restricted for use in particular age groups, the SPCs for individual
                        products should always be referred to when ordering vaccines to ensure that they can be given appropriately to particular patient age groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Research has identified processes at GP surgeries that are associated with higher uptake of influenza vaccine (Dexter <em>et al</em>., 2012). This
                        included, having a named individual at the surgery responsible for the influenza immunisation programme; update and maintenance of an accurate register of
                        patients eligible for influenza immunisation and direct contact with eligible patients inviting them for immunisation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patients should be advised that many other organisms cause respiratory infections similar to influenza during the influenza season, e.g. the common cold
                        and respiratory syncytial virus. Influenza vaccine will not protect against these diseases.

                    <p>
                        Influenza vaccine should be offered, ideally before influenza viruses start to circulate to:

                        The list above is not exhaustive, and the medical practitioner should apply clinical judgement to take into account the risk of influenza exacerbating any
                        underlying disease that a patient may have, as well as the risk of serious illness from influenza itself. Influenza vaccine should be offered in such cases
                        even if the individual is not in the clinical risk groups specified above. Consideration should also be given to the vaccination, with inactivated vaccine,
                        of household contacts of immunocompromised individuals, i.e. individuals who expect to share living accommodation on most days over the winter and
                        therefore for whom continuing close contact is unavoidable. This may include carers (see below).

                    <p>
                        In addition to the above, immunisation should be provided to healthcare and social care workers in direct contact with patients/clients to protect them and
                        to reduce the transmission of influenza within health and social care premises, to contribute to the protection of individuals who may have a suboptimal
                        response to their own immunisations, and to avoid disruption to services that provide their care. This would include:

                        Studies suggest that two doses of inactivated influenza vaccine may be required to achieve adequate antibody levels in younger children who have not
                        received influenza vaccine before (Allison <em>et al</em>., 2006; Neuzil <em>et al</em>., 2006; Ritzwoller <em>et al</em>., 2005; Shuler <em>et al</em>.,
                        2007; Wright <em>et al</em>., 1977). Live attenuated influenza vaccine has been shown to provide greater protection for children than inactivated influenza
                        vaccine (Belshe <em>et al</em>., 2007; Ashkenazi <em>et al</em>., 2006; Fleming <em>et al</em>., 2006) and studies have also shown meaningful efficacy
                        after a single dose of live attenuated influenza vaccine in previously unvaccinated children (Bracco Neto <em>et al</em>., 2009; Block <em>et al</em>.,
                        2009). Given this, JCVI has advised, as set out below, the use of different dosage schedules of influenza vaccine for children depending on their age, the
                        clinical indications, whether they have received influenza vaccine previously and on the type of vaccine offered. This advice differs from some of the
                        SPCs.

                    <p>
                        Live attenuated influenza vaccine (Fluenz&reg;) should be offered to all children aged two or three years (see earlier for age definition) except for
                        those for whom it is unsuitable (see contraindications and precautions sections). A single dose of Fluenz&reg; should be offered, irrespective of whether
                        influenza vaccine has been received previously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those children for whom Fluenz&reg; is unsuitable, a suitable inactivated influenza vaccine should be offered. An inactivated trivalent vaccine can be
                        given to both two and three years olds but the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluarix&#8482; Tetra) is only authorised for children aged three
                        years and older. Children offered inactivated influenza vaccine who have not received influenza vaccine previously should be offered a second dose of the
                        vaccine at least four weeks later. The inactivated influenza vaccines are interchangeable; the second dose, if required, should be given at least four
                        weeks after the first dose in accordance with the manufacturer's SPC for that vaccine.

                    <p>
                        Children aged two years to less than 18 years in clinical risk groups should be offered Fluenz&reg; unless it is unsuitable (see contraindications and
                        precautions sections). Those children who have never received influenza vaccine before and are aged between two and less than nine years should be offered
                        a second dose of Fluenz&reg; at least four weeks later.
                    </p>

                        For those children for whom Fluenz&reg; is unsuitable, a suitable inactivated influenza vaccine should be offered. The quadrivalent inactivated influenza
                        vaccine (Fluarix&#8482; Tetra) is only authorised for children aged three years and older. The quadrivalent vaccine has both influenza B strains and may be
                        better matched and therefore may provide better protection against the circulating B strain(s) than trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines. Children aged
                        less than nine years who have not received inactivated influenza vaccine previously should be offered a second dose of vaccine, at least four weeks after
                        the first dose.

                    <p>
                        Pregnant women should be offered inactivated influenza vaccine. A number of studies show that influenza vaccination during pregnancy provides passive immunity against influenza to infants in the first few months of life following birth (Benowitz <em>et al</em>., 2010; Eick <em>et al</em>., 2010; Zaman <em>et al</em>., 2008; Poehling <em>et al</em>., 2011). A study showed that influenza vaccination reduced the likelihood of prematurity and smaller infant
                        size at birth associated with influenza infection (Omer <em>et al</em>., 2011).

                        A review of studies on the safety of influenza vaccine in pregnancy concluded that inactivated influenza vaccine can be safely and effectively administered
                        during any trimester of pregnancy and that no study to date has demonstrated an increased risk of either maternal complications or adverse fetal outcomes
                        associated with inactivated influenza vaccine (Tamma <em>et al</em>., 2009). Data are more limited for the live attenuated influenza vaccine
                        (Fluenz&reg;). Whilst there is no evidence of risk with live attenuated influenza vaccine (Toback <em>et al</em>., 2012), inactivated influenza vaccines
                        are preferred for those who are pregnant. There is no need, however, to specifically test eligible girls for pregnancy or to advise avoidance of pregnancy
                        in those who have been recently vaccinated.

                        The SPCs for individual products should always be referred to when deciding which vaccine to give. There are very few individuals who cannot receive any
                        influenza vaccine. When there is doubt, appropriate advice should be sought promptly from the screening and immunisation team in the NHS England area team,
                        a consultant in communicable disease control or a consultant paediatrician, so that the period the individual is left unvaccinated is minimised.

                        Confirmed anaphylaxis is rare (see Chapter 8 for further information). Other allergic conditions such as rashes may occur more commonly and are not
                        contraindications to further immunisation. A careful history of the event will often distinguish between true anaphylaxis and other events that are either
                        not due to the vaccine or are not life threatening. In the latter circumstance, it may be possible to continue the immunisation course. Specialist advice
                        must be sought on the vaccines and the circumstances in which they could be given (see Chapter 6 for further information). The risk to the individual of
                        not being immunised must be taken into account.

                    <p>
                        Individuals who have immunosuppression and HIV infection (regardless of CD4 count) should be given influenza vaccine in accordance with the recommendations
                        and contraindications above. These individuals may not make a full antibody response.

                    <p>
                        Consideration should also be given to the influenza vaccination of household contacts of immunocompromised individuals, i.e. individuals who expect to
                        share living accommodation on most days over the winter and therefore for whom continuing close contact is unavoidable.

                    <p>
                        In recent years, inactivated influenza vaccines that are egg-free or have a very low ovalbumin content have become available and studies show they may be
                        used safely in individuals with egg allergy (des Roches <em>et al</em>., 2012). There are no data on the use of live attenuated vaccine (Fluenz&reg;) in
                        children with egg allergy and at the current time Fluenz should not be given to children with an egg allergy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patients with egg allergy can be immunised with an egg-free influenza vaccine if available. Optaflu&#174; is the only available ovalbumin-free influenza
                        vaccine. If no egg-free vaccine is available, patients should be immunised in primary care using an inactivated influenza vaccine with an ovalbumin content
                        less than 0.12 &#181;g/ml (equivalent to 0.06 &#181;g for 0.5 ml dose). Only patients who have either confirmed anaphylaxis to egg or egg allergy with
                        severe uncontrolled asthma (BTS SIGN step 4 or above) should be referred to specialists for immunisation in hospital. Facilities should be available and
                        staff trained to recognise and treat anaphylaxis (see chapter 8). Vaccines with ovalbumin content more than 0.12 &#181;g/ml (equivalent to 0.06 &#181;g for
                        0.5 ml dose) or where content is not stated should not be used in egg-allergic individuals.

                    <p>
                        The ovalbumin content of influenza vaccines is given in Table 19.6.

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Use with antiviral agents against influenza</div>

                    <p>
                        There is a potential for influenza antiviral agents to lower the effectiveness of the live attenuated influenza vaccine (Fluenz&reg;). Therefore,
                        influenza antiviral agents and Fluenz&reg; should not be administered concomitantly. Fluenz&reg; should not be administered within 48 hours following the
                        cessation of treatment with influenza antiviral agents. Administration of influenza antiviral agents within two weeks of administration of Fluenz&reg; may
                        adversely affect the effectiveness of the vaccine.
                    </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Exposure of healthcare professionals to live attenuated influenza vaccine viruses</div>
                    <p>
                        In theory, healthcare workers may have low level exposure to live attenuated influenza vaccine viruses during administration of the vaccine and/or from
                        recently vaccinated patients. The vaccine viruses are cold-adapted and attenuated, and are unlikely to cause symptomatic influenza. In the US, where there
                        has been extensive use of the live attenuated influenza vaccine, no transmission of vaccine virus in healthcare settings ever has been reported and there
                        have been no reported instances of illness or infections from the vaccine virus among healthcare professionals or immunocompromised patients inadvertently
                        exposed. Thus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has considered that the risk of acquiring vaccine viruses from the environment is unknown but
                        is probably low (CDC, 2012). <br>
                        As a precaution, however, very severely immunosuppressed individuals should not administer live attenuated influenza vaccine.
                        Other healthcare workers who are immunosuppressed or pregnant, should take reasonable precautions to avoid inhaling the vaccine and ensure that they
                        themselves are appropriately vaccinated.

                        If an immunocompromised individual receives LAIV then they should be advised to seek medical advice if they develop flu-like symptoms in the four days (the
                        usual incubation period) following administration of the vaccine. If the patient is severely immunocompromised, antiviral treatment should be considered in
                        addition to the above advice. If antivirals are used, then in order to maximise their protection in the forthcoming flu season, the patient should be
                        offered inactivated influenza vaccine. This can be given straight away.

                        Pain, swelling or redness at the injection site, low grade fever, malaise, shivering, fatigue, headache, myalgia and arthralgia are among the commonly
                        reported symptoms after intramuscular or intradermal vaccination. A small painless nodule (induration) may also form at the injection site. These symptoms
                        usually disappear within one to two days without treatment. Nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea, reduced appetite, weakness and headache are common adverse
                        reaction following administration of the live attenuated intranasal vaccine (Fluenz&reg;).

                        Immediate reactions such as urticaria, angio-oedema, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis can occur.

                        The following adverse events have been reported very rarely after influenza vaccination over the past 30 years but no causal association has been
                        established: neuralgia, paraesthesiae, convulsions (see note below) and transient thrombocytopenia, vasculitis with transient renal involvement and
                        neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis.

                    <p>
                        A study in the UK found that there was no association between GuillainBarr&#233; syndrome (GBS) and influenza vaccines although there was a strong
                        association between GBS and influenza-like illness. The increased risk of GBS after influenza-like illness, if specific to infection with influenza virus,
                        together with the absence of a causal association with influenza vaccine suggests that influenza vaccine should protect against GBS (Stowe <em>et al</em>.,
                        2009). GBS has been reported very rarely after immunisation with influenza vaccine, one case per million people vaccinated in one US study (Laskey <em>et al</em>., 1998). However, this has not been found in other studies and a causal relationship has not been established (Hurwitz <em>et al</em>.,
                        1981; Kaplan <em>et al</em>., 1982; Roscelli <em>et al</em>., 1991).

                    <p>
                        All serious suspected reactions following influenza vaccines should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow
                        Card scheme at <strong>www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard</strong>

                        The influenza vaccine Fluenz&reg;, quadrivalent Fluarix&reg; Tetra and Optaflu&#174; carry a black triangle symbol (&#9660;). This is a standard symbol
                        added to the product information of a vaccine during the earlier stages of its introduction, to encourage reporting of all suspected adverse reactions.

                        Epidemiological information from Australia in 2010 indicated a higher than expected rate in febrile convulsions in children under five years of age related
                        to the use of an influenza vaccine manufactured by CSL in Australia (Fluvax). The evidence from Australia indicated an incidence of febrile convulsions in
                        the range of &#8805; 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100 for children under five years of age who were vaccinated with Fluvax.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fluvax is the same product marketed in the UK by Pfizer as Enzira&#174; or CSL Biotherapies generic influenza vaccine. Due to the risk of febrile
                        convulsions, the indication for these products is restricted to use in adults and children aged five years and older. The SPCs also indicate that an
                        increased number of reports of fever were also reported in the age group aged five to under nine years. Clinicians should therefore consider the use of
                        alternative influenza vaccines authorised for use in this age group. If no suitable alternative vaccines are available, clinicians should ensure parents
                        are aware of the risk and give advice on the management of vaccine-induced fever (see chapter 8).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Available evidence indicates that this is a reaction specific to the CSL vaccine, and there remains no evidence that other trivalent influenza vaccines
                        used in the UK are associated with a similar risk of febrile convulsions in children (Stowe <em>et al</em>., 2011; Bryan and Seabroke, 2011).

                        There are indications that the influenza vaccines, Viroflu&#174; (Janssen-Cilag Ltd, formerly Crucell) may be associated with a higher than expected rate
                        of fever in children aged under five years. It remains unclear if this may translate into an increased risk of febrile convulsions in children. As a
                        precaution, clinicians should consider the use of alternative influenza vaccines authorised for use in children under five years of age. If no suitable
                        alternative vaccines are available, clinicians should ensure parents are aware of the risk and give advice on the management of vaccine-induced fever (see
                        chapter 8).

                        Demand for influenza vaccine sometimes increases unpredictably in response to speculation about influenza illness in the community. Therefore, it is
                        recommended that practices order sufficient vaccine for their needs, based on their 'at risk' registers, well in advance of the immunisation season.

                    <p>
                        Information on supplies and how to order vaccines will be given in guidance provided by each of the four UK countries' health departments - see respective
                        websites for details. GPs should order vaccine for those aged 65 years and older and those in clinical risk groups from the influenza vaccine manufacturers
                        (contact details below) as in previous years. However, live attenuated influenza vaccine (Fluenz&#174;) has been purchased centrally for children aged two
                        and three years and should be ordered in the same manner as all the other vaccines for the routine childhood immunisation programme (see chapter 3).
