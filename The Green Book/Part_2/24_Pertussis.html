                    <p>
                        Whooping cough is a highly infectious disease that is usually caused by <em>Bordetella pertussis</em>. A similar illness is caused by <em>B. parapertussis</em>, but this is not preventable with presently available vaccines.
                    </p>
                    <p>There is an initial catarrhal stage, followed by an irritating cough that gradually becomes paroxysmal, usually within one to two weeks. The paroxysms are
                        often followed by a characteristic 'whoop', often accompanied by vomiting. In young infants, the typical 'whoop' may never develop and coughing spasms may
                        be followed by periods of apnoea. The illness often lasts for two to three months. In older children and adults, the disease may be mild and not recognised
                        as whooping cough. </p>
                    <p>
                        Pertussis may be complicated by bronchopneumonia, repeated vomiting leading to weight loss, and cerebral hypoxia with a resulting risk of brain damage.
                        Severe complications and deaths occur most commonly in infants under six months of age. Minor complications include subconjunctival haemorrhages, epistaxis
                        (nosebleeds), facial oedema, ulceration of the tongue or surrounding area, and suppurative otitis media.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transmission of the infection is by droplet, and cases are most infectious during the early catarrhal phase. The incubation period is between six and 20
                        days and cases are infectious from six days after exposure to three weeks after the onset of typical paroxysms.

                        History and epidemiology of the disease
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Before the introduction of pertussis immunisation in the 1950s, the average annual number of notifications exceeded 120,000 in the UK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By 1972, when vaccine coverage was around 80%, there were only 2069 notifications of per tussis. Because of professional and public anxiety about the
                        safety and efficacy of the vaccine, coverage fell to about 30% in 1975 and major epidemics occurred in 1977-79 and 1981-83. In 1978, there were over 68,000
                        notifications and 14 deaths. The actual number of deaths due to pertussis is higher, since not all cases in infants are recognised (Miller and
						Fletcher, 1976). These two major epidemics illustrate the impact of the fall in
						coverage of an effective vaccine.

                    <p>
                        The return of professional and public confidence resulted in increased vaccine uptake. Since the mid-1990s, coverage has been consistently over 90% by the
                        second birthday, with fewer than 6000 notifications per year. In 2002, only 1051 cases were reported. The most recent estimate of deaths in England is nine
                        deaths per year (Crowcroft <em>et al.</em>, 2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the current low levels of disease, pertussis in the very young remains a signifi cant cause of illness and death. The majority of hospitalisations
                        following pertussis have occurred in those under six months of age, some of whom were seriously ill and required admission to paediatric intensive care
                        units (Crowcroft <em>et al.</em>, 2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the morbidity and mortality are highest in infants, high coverage must be maintained to protect those who are too young to be immunised. Adults and
                        older children may infect younger members of their family who are too young to be immunised (Crowcroft <em>et al.</em>, 2003).

                        The acellular vaccines are made from highly purified selected components of the <em>Bordetella pertussis </em>organism. These components are treated with
                        formalde hyde or glutaraldehyde and then adsorbed onto adjuvants, either aluminium phosphate or aluminium hydroxide, to improve immunogenicity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Acellular vaccines differ in source, number of components, amount of each component, and method of manufacture, resulting in differences in efficacy and in
                        the frequency of adverse effects (Edwards and Decker, 2004). The vaccine chosen for primary immunisation in the UK programme (Pediacel) contains five
                        purified pertussis components. This vaccine has been shown to offer equal or better protection against clinically typical pertussis disease than the
                        whole-cell pertussis vaccine previously used in the UK (Miller, 1999). The incidence of local and systemic reactions is lower with acellular pertussis
                        vaccines than with whole-cell pertussis vaccines (Miller, 1999). The five- component vaccine contains pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin
                        (FHA), fimbrial agglutinogens (FIM) 2 and 3, and pertactin (PRN). The three-component vaccine contains PT, FHA and PRN.

                    <p>
                        Three- and five-component pertussis-containing vaccines are provided according to their suitability for pre-school boosting. The pre-school vaccines are
                        not provided for the purpose of primary immunisation. The three- component preparation (DTaP/IPV - Infanrix-IPV) does not provide the same level of
                        protection against whooping cough in primary immunisation. The five-component pre-school preparation (dTaP/IPV- Repevax) does not contain the recommended
                        strength of diphtheria vaccine for primary immunisation.

                        Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&#730;C to +8&#730;C and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive to some extent to heat
                        and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless
                        they have been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause
                        hairline cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.

                        Vaccines are routinely given intramuscularly into the upper arm or antero- lateral thigh. This is to reduce the risk of localised reactions, which are more
                        common when vaccines are given subcutaneously (Mark <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Diggle and Deeks, 2000; Zuckerman, 2000). However, for individuals with a
                        bleeding disorder, vaccines should be given by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pertussis-containing vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as MMR, MenC and hepatitis B. The vaccines should be given at a separate
                        site, preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003). The site
                        at which each vaccine was given should be noted in the patient's records.

                            The primary course of pertussis vaccination consists of three doses of a pertussis-containing product with an interval of one month between each dose.
                            DTaP/IPV/Hib is recommended for all infants from two months up to ten years of age. If the primary course is interrupted it should be resumed but not

                            Children of one to ten years who have completed the primary course plus a reinforcing dose (which includes four doses of diphtheria, tetanus and
                            polio), but have not received four doses of pertussis-containing vaccine, may be offered a dose of combined DTaP/IPV or DTaP/IPV/Hib (if appropriate)
                            to provide some or additional protection against pertussis, preferably allowing an interval of one year from the previous dose.

                            These children will therefore receive an extra dose of diphtheria, tetanus or polio vaccines. Such additional doses are unlikely to produce an
                            unacceptable rate of reactions (Ramsay <em>et al</em>., 1997).

                            Children under ten years of age should receive the first pertussis booster combined with diphtheria, tetanus and polio vaccines. Either of the
                            recommended pre-school vaccines should be used to boost a primary course of whole-cell or acellular pertussis preparations. The first booster of
                            pertussis-containing vaccine should ideally be given three years after completion of the primary course, normally between three years and four months
                            to five years of age.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When primary vaccination has been delayed, this first booster dose may be given at the scheduled visit provided it is one year since the third primary
                            dose. This will re-establish the child in the routine schedule. dTaP/IPV or DTaP/IPV should be used in this age group. Td/IPV should not be used
                            routinely for this purpose in this age group because it does not contain pertussis and has not been shown to give an equivalent diphtheria antitoxin
                            response to other recommended preparations.

                        If a child attends for a booster dose and has a history of receiving a vaccine following a tetanus-prone wound, attempts should be made to identify which
                        vaccine was given. If the vaccine given was the same as that due at the current visit and at an appropriate interval, then the booster dose is not
                        required. Otherwise, the dose given at the time of injury should be discounted as it may not provide satisfactory protection against all antigens, and the
                        scheduled immunisation should be given. Such additional doses are unlikely to produce an unacceptable rate of reactions (Ramsay <em>et al</em>., 1997).

                        Where a child born in the UK presents with an inadequate immunisation history, every effort should be made to clarify what immunisations they may have had
                        (see Chapter 11). A child who has not completed the primary course should have the outstanding doses at monthly intervals. Children may receive the first
                        booster dose as early as one year after the third primary dose to re-establish them on the routine schedule.

                        no reliable history of previous immunisation, it should be assumed that they are unimmunised, and the full UK recommendations should be followed (see

                        Children coming to the UK may have had a fourth dose of a pertussis- containing vaccine that is given at around 18 months in some countries. This dose
                        should be discounted as it may not provide satisfactory protection until the time of the teenage booster. The routine pre-school and subsequent boosters
                        should be given according to the UK schedule.

                        Confirmed anaphylaxis occurs extremely rarely. Data from the UK, Canada and the US point to rates of 0.65 to 3 anaphylaxis events per million doses of
                        vaccine given (Bohlke <em>et al., </em>2003; Canadian Medical Association, 2002). Other allergic conditions may occur more commonly and are not
                        contraindications to further immunisation. A careful history of the event will often distinguish between anaphylaxis and other events that are either not
                        due to the vaccine or not life-threatening. In the latter circum stance, it may be possible to continue the immunisation course. Specialist advice must be
                        sought on the vaccines and circumstances in which they could be given. The risk to the individual of not being immunised must be taken into account.

                        Previous experience suggested that the above events occurred more often after whole-cell DTP vaccine than after DT alone or after DTaP. Following the
                        replacement of whole-cell pertussis vaccine with an acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP/IPV/Hib) in Canada, there was a significant reduction in the number
                        of reports of febrile seizures collected through the Immunization Monitoring Program - ACTive (IMPACT) (Le Saux <em>et al.</em>, 2003). When DTaP vaccines
                        were compared with DT alone, severe general and local reactions occurred at the same rate (Tozzi and Olin, 1997). Therefore, these reactions were not due
                        to the acellular pertussis components.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Children who have had severe reactions, as above, have continued and completed immunisation with pertussis-containing vaccines without recurrence of these
                        reactions (Vermeer-d e Bondt <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Gold <em>et al.</em>, 2000).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Canada, a severe general or local reaction to DTaP/IPV/Hib is not a contra- indi cation to further doses of the vaccine (Canadian Medical Association,
                        1998). Adverse events after childhood immunisation are carefully monitored in Canada (Le Saux <em>et al.</em>, 2003), and experience there suggests that
                        further doses are not associated with recurrence or worsening of the preceding events (S Halperin and R Pless, pers. comm., 2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since local or general reactions are less frequent after acellular than whole-cell pertussis vaccines, the number of children with such events will be
                        small. There is no benefit in withholding acellular pertussis-containing vaccines in order to reduce the risks of adverse events, and there is additional
                        protection from completing pertussis immunisation; this should be carried out in accordance with the routine immunisation schedule. Children who have had a
                        local or general reaction after whole-cell pertussis vaccine should complete their immunisation with acellular pertussis preparations.

                        Pertussis-containing vaccines may be given to pregnant women when protection is required without delay. There is no evidence of risk from vaccinating

                        It is important that premature infants have their immunisations at the appropriate chronological age, according to the schedule. The occurrence of apnoea
                        following vaccination is especially increased in infants who were born very prematurely.

                        Very premature infants (born &#8804; 28 weeks of gestation) who are in hospital should have respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs when given their first
                        immunisation, particularly those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. If the child has apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations after the first
                        immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital, with respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hrs (Pfister <em>et al</em>., 2004; Ohlsson <em>et al</em>., 2004; Schulzke <em>et al</em>., 2005; Pourcyrous <em>et al</em>., 2007; Klein <em>et al</em>., 2008).

                    <p>
                        If there is evidence of current neurological deterioration, including poorly controlled epilepsy, immunisation should be deferred and the child should be
                        referred to a child specialist for investigation to see if an underlying cause can be identified. If a cause is not identified, immunisation should be
                        deferred until the condition has stabilised. If a cause is identified, immunisation should proceed as normal.

                    <p>
                        A family history of seizures is not a contraindication to immunisation. When there is a personal or family history of febrile seizures, there is an
                        increased risk of these occurring after any fever, including that caused by immunisation. Seizures associated with fever are rare in the first six months
                        of life and most common in the second year of life. After this age the frequency falls and they are rare after five years of age.

                        When a child has had a seizure associated with fever in the past, with no evidence of neurological deterioration, immunisation should proceed as
                        recommended. Advice on the prevention and management of fever should be given before immunisation.

                        When a child has had a seizure that is not associated with fever, and there is no evidence of neurological deterioration, immunisation should proceed as
                        recomm ended. When immunised with DTP vaccine, children with a family or personal history of seizures had no significant adverse events and their
                        developmental pro gress was normal (Ramsay <em>et al.</em>,<em> </em>1994).

                        If a child experiences encephalopathy or encephalitis within seven days of immunisation, the advice in the flow chart in Figure 24.4 should be followed. It
                        is unlikely that these conditions will have been caused by the vaccine and they should be investigated by a specialist. Immunisation should be deferred
                        until the condition has stabilised in children where no underlying cause was found <strong>and </strong>the child did not recover completely within seven
                        days. If a cause is identified or the child recovers within seven days, immunisation should proceed as recommended.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a seizure associated with a fever occurs within 72 hours of an immunisation, further immunisation should be deferred until the condition is stable if no
                        underlying cause has been found <strong>and </strong>the child did not recover completely within 24 hours. If a cause is identified or the child recovers
                        within 24 hours, immunisa tion should continue as recommended.

                        There will be very few occasions when deferral of immunisation is required (see above). Deferral leaves the child unprotected; the period of deferral
                        should be minimised so that immunisation can commence as soon as possible. If a specialist recommends deferral, this should be clearly communicated to the
                        general practit ioner, who must be informed as soon as the child is fit for immunisation.

                        Pain, swelling or redness at the injection site are common and may occur more frequently following subsequent doses. A small painless nodule may form at
                        the injection site; this usually disappears and is of no consequence. The incidence of local reactions is lower with vaccines combined with acellular
                        pertussis than with whole-cell pertussis, and is similar to that after DT vaccine (Miller, 1999; Tozzi and Olin, 1997).

                        Confirmed anaphylaxis occurs extremely rarely. Data from the UK, Canada and the US point to rates of 0.65 to 3 anaphylaxis events per million doses (Bohlke <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Canadian Medical Association, 2002). Other allergic conditions may occur more commonly and are not contraindications to further
                        immunisation.

                        In the past, there was public and professional anxiety that whole-cell pertussis vaccine contributed to the onset of neurological problems in young
                        children. Between 1976 and 1979, a total of 1182 children with serious neuro logical illnesses were reported to the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study
                        (NCES). Only 39 of these children had recently received whole-cell pertussis vaccine. The study concluded that whole-cell pertussis vaccine may very rarely
                        be associated with the development of severe acute neurological illness in children who were previously apparently normal; most of these children suffered
                        no apparent harm. The occurrence of a severe encephalopathy after whole-cell pertussis immunisation was sometimes associated with long-term residual
                        neurological damage, but the evidence was insufficient to indicate whether or not whole-cell DTP increased the overall risk of chronic neurological
                        dysfunction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A major review of studies on adverse events after pertussis vaccine was published by the United States Institute of Medicine in 2001 (Howson <em>et al.,</em> 2001). This concluded that the evidence did not indicate a causal relationship between pertussis vaccine and infantile spasms,
                        hypsarrhythmia, Reye's syndrome and sudden infant death syndrome SIDS).

                        Retrospective review of a small number of cases of encephalopathy in infants temporally associated with administration of pertussis-containing vaccines
                        found that most had Dravet, or modified Dravet, syndrome, first recognised as 'severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy' in 1978. Genetic analysis confirmed
                        that most had mutations of the neuronal sodium channel gene <em>SCN1A</em> which is the major recognised cause of this syndrome. Thus, in many of the cases
                        studied, the encephalopathy was of genetic origin (Berkovic <em>et al.,</em> 2006; McIntosh <em>et al.,</em> 2010).

                    <p>
                        Cot deaths (SIDS) occur most commonly during the first year of life and may therefore coincide with the giving of pertussis-containing vaccines. Studies
                        have established that this association is not causal (Fleming <em>et al.</em>, 2001).

                    <p>
                        It has been suggested that pertussis vaccine is linked with the development of asthma and allergy (Odent <em>et al.</em>, 1994). A recent double-blind
                        study of pertussis vaccines found no significant differences in wheezing, itchy rash or sneezing between DTP-immunised children and controls (Nilsson <em>et al.</em>, 2003; DeStefano <em>et al.</em>, 2002). Asthma or allergy are not contraindic ations to the completion of pertussis immunisation.
