                    <p>Shingles (herpes zoster) is caused by the reactivation of a latent varicella  zoster virus (VZV) infection, genrally decades after the primary infection.</p>
                    
                    <p>Primary VZV infection typically occurs during childhood and causes chickenpox
					(varicella); further information on this can be found in Chapter 34. Following
					primary VZV infection, the virus enters the sensory nerves and travels along the
					nerve to the sensory dorsal root ganglia and establishes a permanent latent
					infection. Reactivation of the latent virus leads to the clinical manifestations of
                    shingles, and is associated with immune senescence or suppression of the
                    immune system i.e. immunosuppressive therapy, HIV infection, malignancy
                    and/or increasing age. The annual incidence of shingles for those aged 70 to 79
                    years is estimated to be around 790 to 880 cases per 100,000 people in England
                    and Wales (van Hoek <i>et al</i>., 2009), see Figure 28a.The risk and severity of
                    shingles increases with age.</p>
                    
                    <p>The first signs of shingles begin most commonly with abnormal skin sensations
                    and pain in the affected area of skin (dermatome). Headache, photophobia,
                    malaise and less commonly fever may occur as part of the prodromal phase.
                    Within days or weeks, a unilateral vesicular (fluid filled blisters) rash typically
                    appears in a dermatomal distribution. In immunocompromised individuals, a
                    rash involving multiple dermatomes may occur. The affected area may be
                    intensely painful with associated paraesthesia (tingling, pricking, or numbness of
                    the skin), and intense itching is common (Gilden <i>et al</i>., 1991). The rash typically
                    lasts between two and four weeks.</p>
                    
                    <p>Following the rash, persistent pain at the site, known as post herpetic neuralgia
                    (PHN), can develop and is seen more frequently in older people. Pain that
                    persists for, or appears more than 90 days after the onset of rash (Oxman <i>et al</i>.,
                    2005) is a commonly accepted definition for PHN. On average, PHN lasts from
                    three to six months, but can persist for longer. The severity of pain can vary and
                    may be constant, intermittent or triggered by stimulation of the affected area,
                    such as by wind on the face. (Katz <i>et al</i>., 2004)</p>
                    
                    <p>Other complications of shingles depend on the nerves affected and include
                    paresis (motor weakness), facial palsy and&#145;herpes zoster ophthalmicus&#146;, with
                    involvement of the eye and associated dermatome, which may result in keratitis,
                    corneal ulceration, conjunctivitis, retinitis, optic neuritis and/or glaucoma.
                    (Shaikh S <i>et al</i>., 2002; Pavan LD, 1995).</p>
                    
                    <p>The reactivated virus can, in some cases, disseminate into the lungs, liver, gut,
                    and brain, leading to pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, and disseminated
                    intravascular coagulopathy. Disseminated disease is more likely to occur in those
                    who are severely immunocompromised, with a case fatality rate reported to be
                    between 5and 15%, and most deaths being attributable to pneumonia (Rogers
                    <i>et al</i>., 1995; Gnann <i>et al</i>., 1991).</p>
                    
                    <p>Individuals with active lesions, particularly if they are immunosuppressed, can
                    transmit VZV to susceptible individuals to cause chickenpox and therefore at
                    risk individuals who have had a significant exposure to shingles require post
                    exposure management(see Chapter 34). There is no evidence that shingles can
                    be acquired from another individual who has chickenpox.</p>
                    
                    <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>
                    
                    <p>Varicella infection is a prerequisite for the development of shingles. In
                    temperate climates in the absence of a varicella vaccination programme, the
                    lifetime risk for varicella infection is over 95% (Banz <i>et al</i>., 2003).</p>
                    
                    <p>Although shingles can occur at any age, incidence increases with age (see
                    Figure 28a) with an estimated lifetime risk of one in four, (Miller <i>et al</i>., 1993).
                    The increasing incidence with age is thought to be associated with age related
                    immune senescence and decline in cell mediated immunity.</p>
                    
                    <p>Age-specific incidence rates of shingles have been estimated using a number
					of different primary care derived data sources (van Hoek <i>et al</i>., 2009)</p>
                    
                    <p>Data from GP-based studies in England and Wales suggest that over 50,000
                    cases of shingles occur in older people aged 70 years and over annually. The
                    severity of shingles generally increases with age and can lead to PHN (Figure
                    28a) that can require hospitalisation (Table 28a). Studies have estimated ophthalmic zoster to
                    occur in 10-20% of shingles cases (Opstelten <i>et al</i>., 2002) with around 4% of
                    the cases resulting in long-term sequelae, including pain (Bowsher,1999).</p>

                    of shingles results in death (van Hoek <i>et al</i>., 2009), although due to the nature
                    of the population and risk of co-morbidities some deaths recorded as being
                    shingles related may not be directly attributable to the disease.</p>

                    <p>Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  is the only market authorised shingles vaccine available in the UK.
                    It contains live, attenuated virus derived from the Oka/Merck strain of varicella
					zoster virus, at a significantly higher dose than the Varivax<sup>&reg</sup>  varicella vaccine.</p>
                    
                    <p>In a clinical trial, one dose of Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  was assessed in 38,546 adults aged 60
                    years and over of whom 17,775 were aged 70 or over. The Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  vaccine
                    reduced the incidence of shingles in those aged 60 years and over and in
                    those aged 70 years and over by 51.3 and 38%, and the incidence of PHN
                    by 66.5 and 66.8% in those aged 60 and 70 years and older respectively
                    (Oxman <i>et al</i>., 2005; Oxman <i>et al</i>., 2008). The vaccine is well tolerated and is
                    also immunogenic in individuals who have had a history of shingles prior to
                    vaccination (Levin <i>et al</i>., 2008).</p>
                                        
                    <p>In clinical trials with Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  , transmission of the vaccine virus has not been
                    reported. However, experience with varicella vaccines which use a lower dose
                    of the same virus strain suggests that transmission of vaccine virus occurs
                    rarely between those vaccinees that develop a varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-like
                    rash and susceptible close contacts. Transmission of vaccine virus from
varicella vaccine recipients without VZV-like rash has not been confirmed.
Whilst there remains a theoretical risk, therefore, of transmitting the attenuated
vaccine virus to a susceptible individual from those who develop a rash
following zoster vaccination, this should be weighed against the reduced risk
of developing natural shingles and PHN and the much higher risk of
transmission from the circulating wild type VZV in the community.</p>
                    
                    <p>The full duration of protection following a single dose of Zostavax<sup>&reg;</sup> is not
known. In the original clinical trials the average follow up was 3.09 years
although it is likely that the vaccine confers protection for longer. The latest
data (Schmader <i>et al</i>., 2012) shows the vaccine to be effective at least five years
post vaccination and follow up is continuing. The need for, or timing of,
revaccination with Zostavax<sup>&reg;</sup> has therefore not yet been determined.</p>
                    
                     <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>
                    
                    <P>The unreconstituted vaccine and its diluent should be stored in the original
                    packaging at +2&degC to +8&degC and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive
                    to some extent to heat and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most
                    vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness may be reduced unless
                    the vaccine is stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased
                    reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause hairline
                    cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.</P>
                                        
                     <div id="thirdtitle">Presentation</div>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  is available as a lyophilised preparation (an off-white compact
                    crystalline plug) for reconstitution with a diluent (a clear colourless fluid).
                    When reconstituted, Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  is a semi-hazy to translucent, off-white to pale
                    yellow liquid.</p>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  is supplied as a vial and a prefilled syringe, with two separate
                    needles in the secondary packaging. Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  is only available in single
                    packs.</p>
                    
                    <p>After reconstitution of the lyophilised suspension, the vaccine should be used
					immediately, but may be used up to 30 minutes following reconstitution.</p>
                    
                     <div id="thirdtitle">Dosage and schedule</div>
                    
                    <p>Adults should receive a single <b>0.65ml</b> dose of Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  </p>
                    
                    <p>The need for and timing of reinforcing doses have not yet been determined.</p>
                    
                     <div id="thirdtitle">Administration</div>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  must be administered by <b>subcutaneous</b> injection preferably in the
                    deltoid region of the upper arm. It should not be given by intramuscular injection
                    as there is insufficient data on the effectiveness of the vaccine given by this route.
                    The vaccine must not be given intravascularly. Further information on injection
                    technique can be found in Chapter 4.</p>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  can be given at the same time as inactivated influenza vaccination. If
                    given at the same time as influenza vaccination, care should be taken to ensure
                    that the appropriate route of injection is used for all the vaccinations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether administered at the same time as other vaccines or separately, as the
                    eligible population are likely to have a high prevalence of co-morbidities, it is
                    important to check that the recipient has no contraindications to administering a
                    live vaccine.</p>
                                        
                    <p>Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  can be given at the same time as 23-valent pneumococcal
                    polysaccharide vaccine for those who are eligible for both vaccines. Although a
                    manufacturer-conducted trial showed inferior VZV antibody responses in those
                    receiving zoster vaccine and PPV-23 concomitantly compared with those
                    receiving the vaccines four weeks apart, there is no established correlation
                    between antibody titres to VZV and protection from herpes zoster. Furthermore,
                    a more recent observational study showed that herpes zoster vaccine was equally effective at preventing herpes zoster regardless of whether it was administered at
the same as PPV-23 or four weeks apart( Tseng <i>et al</i>., 2011).</p>
                    
                    <p>The vaccines should be given at separate sites, preferably in different limbs. If
                    given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American
                    Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). The site at which each vaccine was given should
                    be noted in the individual's records.</p>
                    
                    <p>Based on evidence that MMR vaccine can lead to an attenuation of the varicella
vaccine response (Mullooly et al., 2001), it is recommended that, a four-week
interval is observed between administration of MMR and Zostavax® vaccines to
ensure adequate protection.</p>
                    
                    <p>Travel vaccines containing live attenuated virus, e.g. yellow fever, may be given
                    to the age group recommended for shingles vaccination There is limited evidence
                    on the timing of administration of Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup> and yellow fever vaccine, with a
                    single case report demonstrating good response to yellow fever vaccine 21 days
                    after receiving Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup> (Stier <i>et al</i>, 2012). Given the lack of data it would be
                    appropriate to leave a four week interval between administration of yellow fever

                    <p>The aim of the national shingles immunisation programme is to lower the
                    incidence and severity of shingles in older people. It is recommended that it
                    be routinely offered to people aged 70 years.</p>
                    
                    <p>A catch-up programme is also being rolled out in those aged 70-79 years,
based on evidence of cost effectiveness and as this age group is likely to have
the greatest benefit from vaccination (van Hoek et al., 2009). The reasons for
this include:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>the burden of shingles disease within this age group (which increases with age),</span></li>
                        <li><span>the estimated effectiveness of the vaccine within this age group (which decreases with age),</span></li>
                        <li><span>the duration of protection of the vaccine, and</span></li>
                        <li><span>the lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of a second dose of vaccine.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The course consists of a single dose of Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup> .</p>
                    
                    <p>As Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  can be administered concomitantly with inactivated influenza
                    vaccine, the appointment for administration of the seasonal influenza vaccine
                    is an appropriate opportunity to also provide Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup> , although any
                    opportunity to provide the vaccine should be used.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whilst the vaccine is authorised for use from age 50 years and is effective in
                    this age group, the burden of shingles disease is generally not as severe in those
                    aged 50-69 years when compared with older ages. Furthermore, given that the
                    duration of protection is not known, offering vaccination routinely below
                    70 years of age may not confer protection during the period where the burden
                    of disease is highest. Administration after 80 years of age is less cost-effective
                    due to the limited effectiveness of the vaccine in older individuals.</p>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax is not indicated for prevention of primary VZV infection (chickenpox)
					and should not be used in children and adolescents.</p>

                   <p><b>Special considerations on vaccination of individuals on
immunosuppressive therapy</b></p>
                  <p>Individuals who have undergone immunosuppressive chemotherapy or
radiotherapy for malignancy should not receive the vaccine until six months
after the end of treatment, and they are demonstrated to be in remission.
Clinicians may wish to discuss with the specialist caring for the patient prior
to administration.</p>
                  <p>Individuals receiving high dose steroids should not receive the vaccine until at
least three months after cessation of therapy. For those age cohorts included in
the national vaccination programme, it may be appropriate to extend this
period to six months, before administering vaccine.</p>
                  <p>Therapy with a single, low-dose, non-biological oral immune modulating drug,
either alone or with low dose steroids, for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,
psoriasis, polymyositis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other
conditions, are not necessarily sufficiently immunosuppressive to contraindicate
administration of zoster vaccine. In these individuals, the degree of
immunosuppression should be assessed on a case by case basis. Specialists
with responsibility for patients in the vaccine eligible age cohorts should
include a statement of their opinion on the patient’s suitability for Zostavax®
in their correspondence with primary care. If clinicians administering the
vaccine have concerns about the nature of therapies (including biologics) or
degree of immunosuppression they should contact the relevant specialist.
The vaccine is not contraindicated for use in individuals who are receiving
topical/inhaled corticosteroids and in people who are receiving corticosteroids
as replacement therapy (e.g. for adrenal insufficiency).</p>
                  <p>Asplenia/splenectomy is not of itself a contraindication, though the underlying
cause may be (such as leukaemia or lymphoma infiltration).</p>
                  <p>Humoral deficiencies affecting IgG or IgA antibodies are not of themselves a
contraindication unless associated with T cell deficiencies. If there is any
doubt (e.g. common variable immune deficiency), immunological advice
should be sought.</p>
                  <p>Unless stated differently above, the information on contraindications and
special considerations for vaccination found in Chapter 6 of the Green Book

                    <p>Immunisation of individuals who are acutely unwell should be postponed
                    until they have recovered fully. This is to avoid confusing the diagnosis of
                    any acute illness by wrongly attributing any sign or symptoms to the adverse
                    effects of the vaccine.</p>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup> is not recommended for the treatment of shingles or post herpetic
                    neuralgia (PHN). Individuals who have shingles or PHN should wait until
                    symptoms have ceased before being considered for shingles immunisation.
                    The natural boosting that occurs following an episode of shingles, however,
                    makes the benefit of offering zoster vaccine immediately following recovery
                    limited. In immunocompetent individuals who develop shingles, vaccination
                    should be delayed for one year. Patients who have two or more episodes of
                    shingles in one year should have immunological investigation prior to
                    vaccination. Clinicians may wish to discuss such cases with local specialist
                    teams.</p>

                    in adults who are known to be infected with HIV with or without evidence
                    of immunosuppression (see contraindications). On basis of limited Phase II
                    trial data (Benson <i>et al</i>., 2012) and extrapolation from other live vaccines
                    (Koenig <i>et al</i>., 2013) a CD4 count of 200 cells/μl may be a suitable cut off
                    value. Immunosuppressed patients who require protection against shingles
                    should seek advice from a specialist.</p>

                    <p>Immunosuppressed individuals who are inadvertently vaccinated with
                    Zostavax should be urgently assessed to establish the degree of
                    immunosuppression. As all individuals of this age group should be VZV
                    antibody positive, varicella-zoster immunoglobulin is unlikely to be of
                    benefit but prophylactic aciclovir may be considered in those for whom the
                    attenuated vaccine virus poses a significant risk. Immunosuppressed
                    individuals who develop a varicella rash following inadvertent vaccination
                    can be offered prompt treatment with aciclovir.</p>
                    
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Transmission</div>
                    
                    <p>Post-marketing experience with varicella vaccines suggests that transmission
                    of vaccine virus may occur rarely between those vaccinated who develop a
                    varicella-like rash and susceptible contacts, although there has been no
                    evidence of transmission of herpes zoster vaccine virus between vaccinees
                    and susceptible contacts in the prelicensure clinical trials of Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup></p>
                                        
                    <p>As a precautionary measure, any person who develops a vesicular rash after
                    receiving Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup> should ensure the rash area is kept covered when in
                    contact with a susceptible (chickenpox naïve) person until the rash is dry and
                    crusted. If an immunosuppressed person inadvertently receives vaccine, they
                    should avoid contact with susceptible people until the rash is dry and crusted,
                    due to the higher risk of virus shedding.</p>
                    
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Inadvertent vaccination in individuals under 50 years of age</div>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  is licensed for use in individuals over 50 years of age. However,
                    most adults below the age of 50 years are likely to be immune to varicella
                    and therefore inadvertent vaccination with Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  is unlikely to result in
                    serious adverse reactions. Based on limited data from two clinical trials
                    including VZV-seronegative or low seropositive adults aged 30 years and
                    older, the rates of local and systemic reactions were similar to those reported
                    by other subjects who received the vaccine as part of a clinical trial. No
                    serious vaccine related reactions were reported.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  is similar to the varicella vaccine, it has a significantly
                    higher antigen content. Early trials in susceptible children used vaccine at
                    doses approaching the range used in Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  (Weibel <i>et al.,</i> 1984). The high
                    dose formulation was well tolerated and efficacious. Inadvertent vaccination
                    with Zostavax<sup>&reg</sup>  in varicella na&iuml;ve children is unlikely to result in serious
                    adverse reactions and should count as a valid dose of varicella vaccine.</p>

                    swelling, and pruritis (itching). Other common reactions reported in at least
                    one in 100 people were haematoma, induration and warmth at the injection
                    site, pain in arm or leg and headache. Very rarely, a varicella (chickenpox) like-illness
                    was reported, in fewer than one in 10,000 people.</p>
