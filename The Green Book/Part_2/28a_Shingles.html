                    <p>Shingles (herpes zoster) is caused by the reactivation of a latent varicella</p>
                    
                    <p>Primary VZV infection typically occurs during childhood and causes chickenpox
					(varicella); further information on this can be found in Chapter 34. Following
					primary VZV infection, the virus enters the sensory nerves and travels along the
					nerve to the sensory dorsal root ganglia and establishes a permanent latent
					infection. It is not known what causes reactivation of the latent virus, which leads
					to the clinical manifestations of shingles, but reactivation is usually associated
					with conditions that depress the immune system such as immunosuppressive
					therapy, HIV infection and/or old age. The incidence of shingles in England and
					Wales is estimated to be around 790 to 880 cases per 100,000 people per year
					for those aged 70 to 79 years (van Hoek et al., 2009), see Figure 1.The risk and
					severity of shingles increases with age.</p>
                    
                    <p>The first signs of shingles begin most commonly with abnormal skin sensations
                    and pain in the affected area of skin (dermatome). Headache, photophobia,
                    malaise and less commonly fever may occur as part of the prodromal phase.
                    Within days or weeks, a unilateral vesicular (fluid filled blisters) rash typically
                    appears in a dermatomal distribution. In immunocompromised individuals, a
                    rash involving multiple dermatomes may occur. The affected area may be
                    intensely painful with associated paraesthesia (tingling, pricking, or numbness of
                    the skin), and intense itching is common (Gilden et al., 1991). The rash typically
                    lasts between two and four weeks.</p>
                    
                    <p>Following the rash, persistent pain at the site, known as Post Herpetic Neuralgia
                    (PHN), can develop and is seen more frequently in older people. Pain that
                    persists for, or appears more than 90 days after the onset of rash (Oxman et al.,
                    2005) is a commonly accepted definition for PHN. On average, PHN lasts from
                    three to six months, but can persist for longer. The severity of pain can vary and
                    may be constant, intermittent or triggered by stimulation of the affected area,
                    such as by wind on the face. (Katz et al., 2004)</p>
                    
                    <p>Other complications of shingles depend on the nerves affected and include
                    paresis (motor weakness), facial palsy and ‘herpes zoster ophthalmicus’, with
                    involvement of the eye and associated dermatome, which may result in keratitis,
                    corneal ulceration, conjunctivitis, retinitis, optic neuritis and/or glaucoma.
                    (Shaikh S et al., 2002; Pavan LD, 1995).</p>
                    
                    <p>The reactivated virus can, in some cases, disseminate into the lungs, liver, gut,
                    and brain, leading to pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, and disseminated
                    intravascular coagulopathy. Disseminated disease is more likely to occur in those
                    who are severely immunocompromised, with a case fatality rate reported to be
                    between 5and 15%, and most deaths being attributable to pneumonia (Rogers
                    et al., 1995; Gnann et al., 1991).</p>
                    
                    <p>Individuals with active lesions, particularly if they are immunosuppressed, can
                    transmit VZV to susceptible individuals to cause chickenpox and therefore at
                    risk individuals who have had a significant exposure to shingles require post
                    exposure management(see Chapter 34). There is no evidence that shingles can
                    be acquired from another individual who has chickenpox.</p>
                    
                    <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>
                    
                    <p>Varicella infection is a prerequisite for the development of shingles. In
                    temperate climates in the absence of a varicella vaccination programme, the
                    lifetime risk for varicella infection is over 95% (Banz et al., 2003).</p>
                    
                    <p>Although shingles can occur at any age, incidence increases with age (see
                    Figure 1) with an estimated lifetime risk of one in four, (Miller et al., 1993).
                    The increasing incidence with age is thought to be associated with age related
                    immune senescence and decline in cell mediated immunity.</p>
                    
                    <p>Age-specific incidence rates of shingles have been estimated using a number
					of different primary care derived data sources (van Hoek et al., 2009)</p>
                    
                    <p>Data from GP-based studies in England and Wales suggest that over 50,000
                    cases of shingles occur in older people aged 70 years and over annually. The
                    severity of shingles generally increases with age and can lead to PHN (Figure
                    1) that can require hospitalisation. Studies have estimated ophthalmic zoster to
                    occur in 10-20% of shingles cases (Opstelten et al., 2002) with around 4% of
                    the cases resulting in long-term sequelae, including pain (Bowsher,1999).</p>

                    Figure 28a.1 Upper panel Estimated annual age-specific incidence of shingles

                    Data taken from van Hoek et al., 2009.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is estimated that, in people aged 70 years and over, around one in 1000 cases
                    of shingles results in death (van Hoek et al., 2009), although due to the nature
                    of the population and risk of co-morbidities some deaths recorded as being
                    shingles related may not be directly attributable to the disease.</p>
                    
                    <p>The risk of shingles is also increased in individuals with certain conditions,
                    including systemic lupus erythematosus, (Nagasawa et al.,1990) rheumatoid
                    arthritis, (Smitten et al., 2007) and Wegener’s granulomatosis. (Wung et al.,
                    2005).</p>

                    <p>Zostavax&reg; is the only market authorised shingles vaccine available in the UK.
                    It contains live, attenuated virus derived from the Oka/Merck strain of varicella
					zoster virus, at a significantly higher dose than the Varivax&reg; varicella vaccine.</p>
                    
                    <p>In a clinical trial, one dose of Zostavax® was assessed in 38,546 adults aged 60
                    years and over of whom 17,775 were aged 70 or over. The Zostavax® vaccine
                    reduced the incidence of shingles by 51.3 and 38%, and the incidence of PHN
                    by 66.5 and 66.8% in those aged 60 and 70 years and older respectively
                    (Oxman et al., 2005; Oxman et al., 2008). The vaccine is well tolerated and is
                    also immunogenic in individuals who have had a history of shingles prior to
                    vaccination (Levin <i>et al</i>., 2008).</p>
                                        
                    <p>In clinical trials with Zostavax®, transmission of the vaccine virus has not been
                    reported. However, experience with varicella vaccines which use a lower dose
                    of the same virus strain suggests that transmission of vaccine virus occuress
                    rarely between those vaccinees that develop a varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-like
                    rash and susceptible close contacts (for example, a susceptible infant/
                    grandchild). Transmission of vaccine virus from varicella vaccine recipients
                    without VZV-like rash has not been confirmed. Therefore there remains a
                    theoretical risk of transmitting the attenuated vaccine virus to a susceptible
                    individual but this should be weighed against the reduced risk of developing
                    natural shingles and potential transmission of natural virus (Zostavax SPC).</p>
                    
                    <p>The duration of protection following a single dose of Zostavax is not known.
                    In the original clinical trials the average follow up was 3.09 years although it
                    is likely that the vaccine confers protection for longer, and follow up is
                    continuing. The need for, or timing of, revaccination with Zostavax® has
                    therefore not yet been determined.</p>
                    
                     <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>
                    
                    <P>The unreconstituted vaccine and its diluent should be stored in the original
                    packaging at +2°C to +8°C and protected from light. All vaccines are sensitive
                    to some extent to heat and cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most
                    vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness may be reduced unless
                    the vaccine is stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased
                    reactogenicity and loss of potency for some vaccines. It can also cause hairline
                    cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents.</P>
                                        
                     <div id="thirdtitle">Presentation</div>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax&reg; is available as a lyophilised preparation (an off-white compact
                    crystalline plug) for reconstitution with a diluent (a clear colourless fluid).
                    When reconstituted, Zostavax&reg; is a semi-hazy to translucent, off-white to pale
                    yellow liquid.</p>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax&reg; is supplied as a vial and a prefilled syringe, with two separate
                    needles in the secondary packaging. Zostavax&reg; is only available in single
                    packs.</p>
                    
                    <p>After reconstitution of the lyophilised suspension, the vaccine should be used
					immediately, but may be used up to 30 minutes following reconstitution.</p>
                    
                     <div id="thirdtitle">Dosage and schedule</div>
                    
                    <p>Adults should receive a single <b>0.65ml</b> dose of Zostavax&reg;</p>
                    
                    <p>The need for and timing of reinforcing doses have not yet been determined.</p>
                    
                     <div id="thirdtitle">Administration</div>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax&reg; must be administered by <b>subcutaneous</b> injection preferably in the
                    deltoid region of the upper arm. It should not be given by intramuscular injection
                    as there is insufficient data on the effectiveness of the vaccine given by this route.
                    The vaccine must not be given intravascularly. Further information on injection
                    technique can be found in Chapter 4.</p>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax&reg; can be given at the same time as inactivated influenza vaccination. If
                    given at the same time as influenza vaccination, care should be taken to ensure
                    that the appropriate route of injection is used for all the vaccinations and to check
                    there are no contraindications to administering a live vaccine to individuals in at
                    risk groups presenting for seasonal influenza vaccination.</p>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax&reg; can be given at the same time as 23-valent pneumococcal
                    polysaccharide vaccine for those who are eligible for both vaccines. Although a
                    manufacturer-conducted trial showed inferior VZV antibody responses in those
                    receiving zoster vaccine and PPV-23 concomitantly compared with those
                    receiving the vaccines four weeks apart, there is no established correlation
                    between antibody titres to VZV and protection from herpes zoster. Furthermore,
                    a more recent observational study showed that herpes zoster vaccine was equally effective at preventing herpes zoster whether it was administered simultaneously
					or four weeks apart( Tseng <i>et al</i>., 2011).</p>
                    
                    <p>The vaccines should be given at separate sites, preferably in different limbs. If
                    given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American
                    Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). The site at which each vaccine was given should
                    be noted in the individual’s records.</p>
                    
                    <p>Travel vaccines containing live attenuated virus e.g. yellow fever, may be given
                    to the age group recommended for shingles vaccination. If live vaccines are
                    given simultaneously, then each vaccine virus will begin to replicate and an
                    appropriate immune response is made to each vaccine. Several days after a live
                    vaccine is given, natural interferon is produced in response to that vaccine.
                    Therefore, if a second live vaccine is given during the time of this response, the
                    interferon may prevent replication and attenuate the response to the second
                    vaccine virus. Based on evidence that MMR vaccine can lead to an attenuation
                    of the varicella vaccine response (Mullooly <i>et al</i>., 2001), the recommended
                    interval between live vaccines is currently four weeks. For this reason, if live
                    vaccines cannot be administered simultaneously, a four-week interval is
                    recommended to ensure adequate protection from the second vaccine.</p>
                    
                    <p>Concurrent administration of Zostavax® and anti-viral medications known to be
                    effective against VZV has not been evaluated, but drugs such as aciclovir are
                    likely to reduce replication of the vaccine virus and therefore attenuate response.</p>

                    <p>The aim of the national shingles immunisation programme is to lower the
                    incidence and severity of shingles in older people. It is recommended that it
                    be routinely offered to people aged 70 years but it can be given to individuals
                    up until the eightieth birthday</p>
                    
                    <p>The impact and cost effectiveness of vaccination is greatest in those aged 70
                    to 79 years of age, (van Hoek et al., 2009) due to a combination of factors
                    including:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>the burden of shingles disease within this age group (which increases with age),</span></li>
                        <li><span>the estimated effectiveness of the vaccine within this age group (which decreases with age),</span></li>
                        <li><span>the duration of protection of the vaccine, and</span></li>
                        <li><span>the lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of a second dose of vaccine.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The course consists of a single dose of Zostavax&reg;.</p>
                    
                    <p>As Zostavax&reg; can be administered concomitantly with inactivated influenza
                    vaccine, the appointment for administration of the seasonal influenza vaccine
                    is an appropriate opportunity to also provide Zostavax®, although any
                    opportunity to provide the vaccine should be used.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whilst the vaccine is authorised for use from age 50 years and is effective in
                    this age group, the burden of shingles disease is generally not as severe when
                    compared with older ages. Furthermore, given that the duration of protection
                    is not known to last more than ten years and the need for a second dose is not
                    known, the vaccine is not recommended to be offered routinely below 70 years
                    of age. Administration after 80 years is less cost-effective due to the limited
                    effectiveness of the vaccine beyond this age.</p>
                    
                    <p>Zostavax is not indicated for prevention of primary VZV infection (chickenpox)
					and should not be used in children and adolescents.</p>
