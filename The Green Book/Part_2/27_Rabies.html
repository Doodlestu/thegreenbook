                    <p>Rabies is an acute viral encephalomyelitis caused by members of the lyssavirus genus. The disease may be caused by rabies virus genotype 1 (classical rabies) or less commonly by rabies-related lyssaviruses. The presentations are clinically indistinguishable. Rabies-related lyssaviruses implicated in human disease include European bat lyssaviruses (EBLVs) and Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV).</p>
                    <p>Infection is usually via the bite or scratch of a rabid animal, most frequently a dog. In some parts of the world, other animals such as bats, cats and monkeys are important sources of exposure. In parts of Europe (including the UK) EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 are found in insectivorous bats and have occasionally caused human disease.</p>
                    <p>
                        On rare occasions, transmission of the virus has occurred through body fluids from an infectious animal coming into contact with an individual&#146;s mucous membranes. Exposure through mucous membranes has a low probability of infection but must be managed as a significant event. Infection does not occur through intact skin. Virus is present in some tissues and fluids of humans with rabies, but person-to-person spread of the disease has not been documented other than in exceptional circumstances. Cases have occurred rarely outside the UK through corneal grafts and other transplanted tissues taken from individuals with rabies.
                    </p>
                    <p>The incubation period is generally between three and 12 weeks, but may range from four days to 19 years. In more than 93% of patients, the onset is within one year of exposure. The onset of illness is insidious. Early symptoms may include paraesthesiae around the site of the wound, fever, headache and malaise. The disease may then present with hydrophobia, hallucinations and maniacal behaviour progressing to paralysis and coma, or as an ascending flaccid paralysis and sensory disturbance. Rabies is almost always fatal, death resulting from respiratory paralysis. There is no specific treatment other than supportive care once clinical symptoms develop.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">History and epidemiology of the disease</div>
                    <p>
                        Rabies in animals occurs in all continents except Antarctica, although individual countries and islands are reported to be rabies-free. In the US, classical rabies virus in animals has become more prevalent since the 1950s; skunks, raccoons and bats account for 85% of animal cases. In Asia, Africa, Central and South America, classical rabies virus (genotype 1) is endemic in feral dogs and is also present in domestic dogs. In Mexico and Central and South America, vampire bats carry the classical rabies virus. Most countries that are declared rabies-free probably have rabies-related viruses in their bat populations. In the UK, EBLV 2 has been detected in Daubenton&#146;s bats (Defra, 2009). The virus has never been detected in the most common bat species, the pipistrelles, in the UK (Defra, 2009). In other parts of Europe and in Australia, other bat species have been affected.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the twentieth century, rabies in wildlife has spread through parts of Central and Western Europe. Foxes have been the main host, but many other animals have also been infected, particularly dogs. The incidence of endemic, fox-adapted rabies in Western Europe fell dramatically in the last years of the twentieth century. This has been largely due to the vaccination of wild and domestic animals. Rabies continues to be reported in domestic animals imported from rabies endemic countries. Rabies remains prevalent in Eastern Europe and Turkey.</p>
                    <p>
                        Worldwide more than 55,000 people die of rabies each year (WHO, 2010). Every year, more than 15 million people worldwide receive a post-exposure preventive regimen to avert the disease -this is estimated to prevent 327 000 rabies deaths annually (WHO, 2010). Most cases are in developing countries, particularly India (Plotkin <i>et al</i>., 2008). In the UK, deaths from classical rabies continue to occur in people infected abroad. Such instances are, however, rare, with 25 deaths having been reported since 1946, five of which have occurred since 2000 and the most recent was in 2012. None had received appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis. A considerable number of people present for medical advice on their return to the UK with a history of exposure to an animal abroad. In 2000, 295 such people received prophylaxis in England and Wales (Hossain <i>et al</i>., 2004). Since then the number of people requiring post- exposure prophylaxis in England and Wales has increased threefold, and is now almost 900 per year of which, 10% were potentially exposed to bats in the UK and 90% were potentially exposed overseas (HPA data, 2009).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No case of indigenous human rabies from animals other than bats has been reported in the UK since 1902. In 2002, a man died from rabies caused by EBLV-2 acquired in the UK from a bat (Fooks <i>et al</i>., 2003). Only three other human cases of EBLV infection (all fatal) have been reported in the past 30 years in Europe (Nathwani <i>et al</i>., 2003).

                    <p>There are currently two rabies vaccines licensed for intramuscular use in the UK:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) (Rabies Vaccine BP); and</span>

                        <li>
                            <span>purified chick embryo cell rabies vaccine (PCEC) (Rabipur&reg).</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Other WHO approved cell culture-derived vaccines are available in other countries.</p>
                    <p>The vaccines available in the UK are thiomersal-free. The vaccines are inactivated, do not contain live organisms and cannot cause the disease against which they protect.</p>
                    <p>HDCV is a freeze-dried suspension of Wistar rabies virus strain PM/WI 38 1503-3M cultured in human diploid cells and inactivated by betapropiolactone. The potency of the reconstituted vaccine is not less than 2.5 IU per 1.0ml dose. It contains traces of neomycin, and human albumin is used as an excipient.</p>
                    <p>The PCEC rabies vaccine is a freeze-dried suspension of the Flury LEP-25 rabies virus strain cultured in chick embryo cells and inactivated with betapropiolactone. The potency of the reconstituted vaccine is not less than 2.5 IU per 1.0ml dose. It contains traces of amphotericin B, chlortetracycline and neomycin.</p>
                    <p>
                        The above rabies vaccines may be used interchangeably to provide protection pre- or post-exposure (Cabasso <i>et al</i>., 1974; Turner <i>et al</i>., 1982; Fekadu <i>et al</i>., 1988; Briggs <i>et al</i>., 1992; Strady <i>et al</i>., 1998; Strady <i>et al</i>., 2000). Intramuscular vaccination with tissue-culture vaccines reliably produces rabies virus neutralising titres in approximately 95% of recipients (Nicholson <i>et al</i>., 1987; Fishbein <i>et al</i>., 1989; Strady <i>et al</i>., 1998). In 95% of individuals, rabies titres are long-lived, particularly if the vaccine has been administered intramuscularly compared with intradermal vaccination (Fishbein <i>et al</i>., 1989; Briggs <i>et al</i>., 1992; Strady <i>et al</i>., 1998; Suwansrinon <i>et al</i>., 2006). Immunologically competent persons who have received a primary course of rabies vaccine have a primed immune response, and will respond promptly once they receive a booster dose of vaccine (Rosanoff <i>et al</i>., 1979; Turner <i>et al</i>., 1982; Fishbein <i>et al</i>., 1986; Naraporn <i>et al</i>., 1999). Therefore, there is no need to perform serologic testing or routine boosting for individuals who are at infrequent risk of rabies infection (see recommendations for the use of rabies vaccine).

                    <p>The vaccine is supplied as freeze-dried powder and solvent for suspension and for injection. The powder is pinkish beige to orangey yellow. The solvent is a clear, colourless solution. Following reconstitution with the solvent supplied, the suspension will be a pinkish colour and free from particles.</p>

                    <p>The vaccine is supplied as freeze-dried powder and solvent for suspension and for injection. The powder is white. The solvent is a clear, colourless solution. Following reconstitution with the solvent supplied, the suspension will be a clear-colourless solution and free from particles.</p>
                    <p>Both vaccines should be used immediately and no later than one hour after reconstitution with the solvent supplied.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Dosage, schedule and administration</div>
                    <p>For primary pre-exposure immunisation, three doses of 1.0ml (2.5 IU) of rabies vaccine should be given intramuscularly on days 0, 7 and 28. The third dose can be given from day 21 if there is insufficient time before travel.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Administration</div>
                    <p>Vaccines are routinely given intramuscularly into the upper arm or anterolateral thigh (Zuckerman, 2000). However, for individuals with a bleeding disorder, vaccines should be given by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.</p>
                    <p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommends the intramuscular rather than the intradermal route for pre-exposure prophylaxis use of rabies vaccine. The committee also recommends that only the intramuscular route (or deep subcutaneous route for those with bleeding disorders) is used for post-exposure prophylaxis.</p>
                    <p>
                        Whilst the intramuscular route is preferred for pre-exposure prophylaxis, suitably qualified and experienced healthcare professionals may give the vaccine via the intradermal route. The 'off label' use of the intradermal route is on the prescriber&#146;s own responsibility as this is not covered by the manufacturer's Product Licence. For pre-exposure intradermal immunisation, 0.1 ml (0.25 IU) of the vaccine can be used according to the schedule above. Intradermal immunisation is reliable only if the whole of the 0.1 ml dose is given properly into the dermis and should only be given by those experienced in the intradermal technique. It should not be used in those taking chloroquine for malaria prophylaxis as this drug suppresses the antibody response if the vaccine is given by the intradermal route (chloroquine does not suppress the antibody response if the vaccine is given by the intramuscular route). Whilst the use of the intradermal route potentially allows the contents of a vial of rabies vaccine to be shared amongst more than one individual, this practice is not recommended and carries the risks of contamination (see chapter 4).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rabies vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines, including other travel vaccines. The vaccines should be given at separate sites, preferably in different limbs. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). The site at which each vaccine was given should be noted in the individual&#146;s records. The vaccinee must keep a record of the vaccine and regimen received as it will influence future post- exposure treatment (see table 27.1).

                    <p>Human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) is obtained from the plasma of immunised and screened human donors. Because of a theoretical risk of transmission of vCJD from plasma products, HRIG used in the UK is now prepared from plasma sourced from outside the UK. All donors are screened for HIV and hepatitis B and C, and all plasma pools are tested for the presence of nucleic acid from these viruses. A solvent detergent inactivation step for envelope viruses is included in the intramuscular/sub-cutaneous products. HRIG is used after high risk exposure to rabies to give rapid protection until rabies vaccine, which should be given at the same time at a separate site, becomes effective.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Storage</div>
                    <p>Human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) should be stored in a refrigerator between +2&degC and +8&degC. This product is tolerant to ambient temperatures for up to one week, and can be distributed in sturdy packaging outside the cold chain if needed.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Administration</div>
                    <p>When indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis (see below), HRIG 20 IU/kg body weight should be infiltrated in and around the cleansed wound. If infiltration of the whole volume is not possible or the wound is healed or not visible, any remaining HRIG should be given intramuscularly in the anterolateral thigh, remote from the vaccination site. If more than 2 ml is to be given to children, or more than 5 ml to adults, the HRIG should be divided into smaller amounts and given into different sites. If vaccine is given but HRIG treatment is delayed, HRIG can still be given up to seven days after starting the course of vaccine.</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Disposal</div>
                    <p>HRIG is for single use and any unused solution should be disposed - see chapter 3.</p>

For frequent exposure risk patients in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, NHS funded serology should be offered only for clinical needs, such as following a severe reaction to a previous rabies vaccine. </div>

                    <p>Individuals who are at continuous risk should have their antibody levels tested every six months. Reinforcing doses of vaccine should be given if serology indicates that antibody levels are below a protective antibody titre of at least 0.5 IU/ml (WHO 2010).</p>
                    <p>For those at frequent risk, a single reinforcing dose of vaccine should be given one year after the primary course has been completed. Further booster doses should then be given at three to five years, or guided by serology as described in table 27.1.</p>
                    <p>Routine boosting is not recommended for those at infrequent risk. For individuals, such as travellers, boosting with a single dose of vaccine can be considered in those who have had a primary course over 10 years ago and are travelling again to a high risk area.</p>

All travellers to enzootic areas should also be informed by their medical advisers of the practical steps to be taken if they are bitten by an animal or have some other types of exposure that puts them at risk of rabies (e.g. when saliva from an infected animal comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes such as the eyes, nose, or mouth).</p>
                    <div id="thirdtitle">Post-exposure management</div>
                    <p>Post-exposure management normally consists of wound treatment and risk assessment for appropriate post exposure prophylaxis. Treatment and immunisation after a possible rabies exposure will depend on the circumstances of the exposure, including the local incidence of rabies in the species involved and the immune status of the person.</p>
                    <p>Detailed guidance on risk assessment and management of potential rabies exposure for England and Wales, and Scotland respectively can be found on the HPA and HPS websites. <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Rabies/Guidelines/', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Rabies/Guidelines/</a> <br><br><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/giz/guidelinedetail.aspx?id=46619', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/giz/guidelinedetail.aspx?id=46619</a></p>
                    <div id="fourthtitle">Wound treatment</div>
                    <p>As soon as possible after the incident, the wound should be cleaned by thorough flushing under a running tap for several minutes and washing with soap or detergent and water. A suitable disinfectant should be applied and the wound covered with a simple dressing. Suitable disinfectants include 40 to 70% alcohol, tincture or aqueous solution of povidone-iodine.</p>
                    <p>Salivary exposures to mucous membranes such as eyes, nose or mouth should be washed thoroughly with clean water as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>Primary suture could cause further damage to the wound and may increase the risk of introduction of rabies virus to the nerves. It should be avoided or postponed until post exposure prophylaxis has commenced. In patients requiring HRIG, sutures (and infiltration of local anaesthetic) should be delayed until HRIG has been infiltrated into the wound.</p>
                    <div id="fourthtitle">Risk assessment</div>
                    <p>Each case requires a full risk assessment based on the collection of the following information about the circumstances of the potential exposure. Health care professionals should try to collect as much of this information as possible to inform the risk assessment.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>The site and severity of the wound: high-risk exposures are those with broken skin, including single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, or where mucous membranes or an existing skin lesion have been contaminated by the animal&#146;s saliva or other body fluid. Intact skin is a barrier against infection. Bites represent a higher risk than scratches. Proximal bites (e.g. head and neck) represent a higher risk than distal wounds.</span>

                    <div id="fourthtitle">Risk assessment for possible bat exposure</div>
                    <p>Both classical rabies virus and rabies-related lyssaviruses may be acquired from bats depending on the species and origin. Following a case of EBLV infection in a bat handler in the UK, bat exposures are an increasing cause for concern. Assessment of the risk from a possible bat contact is more difficult than for a terrestrial animal, but specialist advice should be sought for all bat exposures, including those in the UK. For the purpose of risk assessment all countries are considered to have rabies in their bat populations. Transmission of EBLV can occur in the absence of a recognised contact (e.g. waking to find a bat in the room).</p>
                    <p>Information that is required for an accurate risk assessment of a bat exposure includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>The nature of the contact, e.g. a definite bite or scratch, including site and severity, handling or touching, contact with saliva, urine or faeces or a possible unrecognised exposure. Bat bites or scratches are usually felt and not seen.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Origin and condition of the bat, e.g. country and behaviour of the bat. Bats with rabies may be sick or grounded without injury, but apparently healthy bats may have rabies. If a bat is found dead, it should not be handled, but the Bat Conservation Trust contacted and rabies testing arranged through the Trust, if applicable.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>The vaccination status of the individual at risk (see above).</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <div id="fourthtitle">Post-exposure prophylaxis</div>
                    <p>Risk assessment should be done as soon as possible, so that post exposure prophylaxis, if indicated, can be started promptly. Treatment may need to start before full information is available on the ownership and condition of the biting animal.</p>
                    <p>As the incubation period for rabies can be prolonged, treatment should still be considered even if the interval from exposure is lengthy. Risk assessment should always be done (as above), even if the exposure occurred many months or years previously.</p>
                    <p>Following a risk assessment, if post exposure prophylaxis is indicated, this should be given as in table 27.2. It is particularly important that the first three doses are given as close as possible (within a day or two) of the recommended schedule.</p>
