                    <p>
                        Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a double stranded DNA virus, that infects squamous epithelia including the skin and mucosae of the upper respiratory and
                        anogenital tracts. There are approximately 100 types of HPV, of which about 40 infect the genital tract (McCance, 2004). Although most infections are
                        asymptomatic and self-limiting, genital infection by HPV is associated with genital warts and anogenital cancers in both men and women. HPV viruses are
                        classified as either&#145;high-risk&#146; or&#145;low-risk&#146; types depending on their association with the development of cancer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Genital HPVs are transmitted by sexual contact with an infected individual, primarily through sexual intercourse. The risk therefore, is related to the
                        number of sexual partners, the introduction of a new sexual partner, and the sexual history of any partner. Studies of incident HPV infection, based on HPV
                        DNA detection, demonstrate that acquisition of at least one type of HPV infection often occurs soon after sexual debut with almost 40% of women being
                        infected within two years (Winer <em>et al</em>., 2003; Winer <em>et al</em>., 2008).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of condoms reduces but does not eliminate the risk of sexual transmission. Non-sexual routes of HPV transmission include vertical transmission from
                        mother to newborn baby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Persistent infection by high-risk HPV types is detectable in more than 99% of cervical cancers (Walboomers <em>et al</em>., 1999). Of these high-risk
                        types, HPV16 is responsible for almost 60% and HPV18 for more than 15%, of all cervical cancers in Europe (Smith <em>et al</em>., 2007). A further 11
                        high-risk types have been described (WHO IARC, 2007)

                        . In addition to cervical cancer, HPV is causally associated with other less common cancers, including cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis and anus, and
                        some cancers of the head and neck (Parkin <em>et al</em>., 2006; Stanley, 2007). Infection by multiple types is common (Cusheri <em>et al</em>, 2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The majority of HPV infections are transient and cause no clinical problems. Around 70% of new infections will clear within one year and approximately 90%
                        will clear within two years (Ho <em>et al</em>., 1998; Franco <em>et al</em>., 1999). The median duration of a new infection is eight months. Persistent
                        infection by a high-risk HPV type is the most important causal factor for the development of cervical pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions. Persistence and
                        disease is more common for infections by HPV types 16 and 18 than for other high-risk types. The time span between infection by HPV and the development of
                        CIN3 or cervical cancer varies from one to ten years (Moscicki <em>et al</em>., 2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although high-risk HPV infection is a risk factor for the development of vaginal or vulval lesions, unlike cervical cancer, only approximately 40% are
                        associated with HPV infection (Munoz <em>et al</em>., 2006). The natural history of vaginal and vulval cancers is not completely understood. HPV infection
                        is associated with 80-90% of all anal squamous cell cancers and HPV types 16 and 18 are found in the majority of HPV-related anal cancers (Munoz <em>et al</em>., 2006). Around 40% of cases of penile cancer are attributable to HPV infection (Rubin <em>et al</em>., 2001). For all sites, the evidence
                        for a causal association is greater for HPV types 16 and 18, than for other HPV types, and the majority of HPV related cancers are associated with types 16
                        and 18.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Low-risk HPV types are responsible for genital warts, which is the most commonly diagnosed viral sexually transmitted infection in the UK (Fenton <em>et al</em>., 2004), (HPA, 2012). HPV types 6 and 11 cause the majority of all genital warts (Lacey <em>et al</em>., 2006; Garland <em>et al</em>.,
                        2007). Genital warts appear from three weeks to eight months after primary infection (most commonly two to three months) (Oriel, 1971). In the absence of
                        treatment, up to 30% of individuals clear the infection in the short term (Tyring <em>et al</em>., 1998; Edwards <em>et al</em>., 1998). The rate of
                        spontaneous regression in the long term is not known. Treatments focus on removal of the warts, but do not necessarily eliminate infection, which may
                        persist sub-clinically, and be a source of recurrence and continuing viral transmission. Genital warts are not life threatening, but they can cause
                        significant morbidity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HPV infection has been associated with cancerous and non-cancerous lesions outside the ano-genital area including laryngeal papillomas, (Stamataki <em>et al</em>., 2007) and some head and neck cancers (Psyrri <em>et al</em>., 2008).

                        Surveillance of HPV is complex due to the high proportion of asymptomatic infections, the variable presentation of the different viral types, and the long
                        period between infection and disease.

                        A UK seroprevalence study in an unselected population showed that HPV prevalence was extremely low in girls aged 14 years but HPV infections rise sharply
                        in the mid-teens. Among 10- to 29-year-old women, 11%, 3%, 12% and 5% have evidence of ever having been infected by HPV types 6, 11, 16 or 18 respectively
                        (Jit <em>et al</em>., 2007).

                    <p>
                        Information on the prevalence of high-risk HPV infection is available from a large cross-sectional study of women having routine cervical screening in
                        England (Howell-Jones <em>et al</em>., 2010). This study found evidence of current high-risk HPV infection (indicated by the presence of HPV DNA) in 29% of
                        women aged 25 to 29 years, with prevalence declining with increasing age after 30 years. Prevalence of any HPV type, and particularly of HPV 16 or 18, was
                        higher in women who had abnormal cytology.

                        Information on incidence of genital warts comes primarily from people attending genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. Over 90,000 new cases of genital
                        warts were diagnosed in GUM clinics throughout the UK in 2009 (HPA, 2012). Rates of diagnoses are highest in young men and women under 24 years.

                        Cervical cancer is the second commonest cancer of women worldwide, with approximately 500,000 new cases and 270,000 deaths annually (Munoz <em>et al</em>.,
                        2006; Parkin <em>et al</em>., 2006).

                    <p>
                        The introduction of a national cervical screening programme in the UK has made a major contribution to the fall in the incidence and death rate from
                        cervical cancer. Due to cervical screening in the UK, mortality rates fell approximately 60% between 1974 and 2004 (Peto <em>et al</em>., 2004).

                        HPV vaccines are sub-unit vaccines made from the major protein of the viral-coat or capsid of HPV. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are prepared from
                        recombinant proteins grown in either yeast or baculovirus infected insect cells (the latter derive from a type of moth). VLPs mimic the structure of the
                        native virus but do not contain any viral DNA. There are currently two different HPV vaccine products. Cervarix<sup>&#174;</sup> contains VLPs for two HPV
                        types (16 and 18 &#8211; bivalent vaccine) and Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> contains VLPs for four HPV types (6, 11, 16 and 18 &#8211; quadrivalent vaccine).
                        The VLPs used in Cervarix<sup>&#174;</sup> are adjuvanted by AS04 containing 3-O-desacyl-4'- monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide.
                        The VLPs used in Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> are adsorbed on amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulphate adjuvant.

                    <p>
                        The above vaccines do not contain thiomersal. They do not contain live organisms and cannot cause the diseases against which they protect.

                        HPV vaccines are highly effective at preventing the infection of susceptible women with the HPV types covered by the vaccine. In clinical trials in young
                        women with no evidence of previous infection, both vaccines are over 99% effective at preventing pre-cancerous lesions associated with HPV types 16 or 18
                        (Harper <em>et al</em>., 2006; Ault <em>et al</em>., 2007; Lu <em>et al</em>., 2011). Current studies suggest that protection is maintained for at least
                        seven years. Based on the immune responses, it is expected that protection will be extended further; long-term follow-up studies are in place. Some other
                        high-risk HPV types are closely related to those contained in the vaccines, and vaccination has been shown to provide some cross-protection against
                        infection by these types (Brown <em>et al</em>., 2009; Lehtinen <em>et al</em>., 2012). Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> is also 99% effective at preventing
                        genital warts associated with vaccine types in young women (Barr <em>et al</em>., 2007).

                        For planning purposes, a vaccination schedule of 0, 1, 4-6 months is appropriate for both vaccines. All three doses should be ideally given within a
                        12-month period. If the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated, ideally allowing the appropriate interval
                        between the remaining doses.

                    <p>
                        There is no clinical data on whether the interval between doses two and three can be reduced below three months. Where the second dose is given late and
                        there is a high likelihood that the individual will not return for a third dose after three months or if, for practical reasons, it is not possible to
                        schedule a third dose within this time-frame, then a third dose can be given at least one month after the second dose. This applies to both Cervarix <sup>&#174;</sup> and Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup>.

                    <p>
                        Whenever possible, immunisations for all individuals should follow the recommended 0, 1, 4-6 month schedule.

                    <p>
                        The advice below applies to those girls and young women who are eligible to receive HPV vaccination as part of the national HPV immunisation programme as
                        described in the guidance issued by the Department of Health (PL/CMO/2008/4).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If an individual has started a course of Cervarix<sup>&#174;</sup>, then this course should, where possible, be completed with Cervarix<sup>&#174;</sup>.
                        In instances where this is not possible or where the make of the initial vaccination is not known, then the vaccination course can be completed with
                        Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> to three doses in total. The course should be completed according to a vaccination schedule of 0, 1, 4-6 months. As there is no
                        evidence on the interchangeability of the two HPV vaccine products, this advice is based on expert judgement of the data from partial courses of each
                        vaccine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is not advisable to implement a three-dose course of Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> following a partial or complete course of Cervarix<sup>&#174;</sup> as
                        there are no safety data on individuals who receive mixed courses of vaccines involving four or more HPV vaccine doses.

                    <p>
                        The primary purpose of the national immunisation programme is to protect against cervical cancer. It would not be appropriate, therefore, as part of the
                        NHS programme, to offer Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> to those who have had a full course of Cervarix<sup>&#174;</sup> with the aim of providing additional
                        protection against genital warts.

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Administration</div>

                    <p>
                        Vaccines are routinely given intramuscularly into the upper arm or anterolateral thigh. This is to reduce the risk of localised reactions, which are more
                        common when vaccines are given subcutaneously (Mark <em>et al</em>., 1999; Zuckerman, 2000; Diggle <em>et al</em>., 2000). However, for individuals who
                        have a bleeding disorder, vaccines should be given by deep subcutaneous injection to reduce the risk of bleeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HPV vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as Td/ IPV, MMR and hepatitis B. A trend of lower anti-HPV titres has been observed when
                        Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> is administered concomitantly with dTaP, dT/IPV and dTaP/IPV vaccines, though the clinical significance of this observation is
                        unclear. The vaccines should be given at a separate site, preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm
                        apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). The site at which each vaccine was given should be noted in the individual's records.
                    </p>

                    <p>Equipment used for vaccination, including used vials, ampoules, or partially discharged vaccines should be disposed of at the end of a session by sealing in a proper, puncture-resistant'sharps'; box according to local authority regulations and guidance in the technical memorandum 07-01 (Department of Health, 2006). </p>

                        The objective of the HPV immunisation programme is to provide three doses of HPV vaccine to females before they reach an age when the risk of HPV infection
                        increases and puts them at subsequent risk of cervical cancer.

                        Prevention of HPV infection in those eligible for vaccination and in others outside of the routine programme should include advice on safer sex. All women,
                        whether vaccinated or not, should be strongly encouraged to attend routine cervical screening at the scheduled age.

                    <p>From September 2008, HPV vaccination was routinely recommended for all girls at 12 to 13 years of age (school year 8 or S2 in Scotland or school year 9 in Northern Ireland). The course of HPV vaccination should be administered according to the guidance given in the dosage and schedule section. If the course is interrupted then it should be resumed but not repeated, ideally allowing the appropriate interval between the remaining doses. </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Females aged 13 to under 18 years </div>
                    <p>Girls aged 13 years to under 18 years, who are in or have completed school year 9 (S3 in Scotland or school year 10 in Northern Ireland), should have been offered HPV vaccine as part of the routine programme, or catch-up programmes run in 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11. For girls with unknown or incomplete immunisation status see below. </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Females aged 18 or over</div>
                    <p>Vaccination for females over the age of 18 years is not covered by the national HPV vaccination programme. However, for girls who commenced, but did not complete vaccination in the catch-up programmes (born after 1 September 1990), it is reasonable to complete their HPV vaccination course after the age of 18 years. </p>

                        Where a female in the target cohort aged over 12 and under 18 years presents with an inadequate vaccination history, every effort should be made to clarify what doses she has had. A female who has started but did not complete the schedule before reaching the age of 18 years, should complete the vaccination course at the minimum interval (see above) where possible. The course of HPV vaccination should be administered according to the guidance given in the dosage and schedule section. If the course is interrupted then it should be resumed but not repeated, ideally allowing the appropriate interval between the remaining doses.<br> Females coming to the UK from overseas and registered with a GP practice may not have been offered protection against HPV in their country of origin and should be offered vaccination if they are aged under 18 years. If they are aged 18 years or over, and commenced, but did not complete vaccination, it is reasonable to complete their HPV vaccination course.

                        There are very few individuals who cannot receive HPV vaccine. Where there is doubt, appropriate advice should be sought from an immunisation coordinator
                        or consultant in health protection rather than withholding vaccination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The vaccine should not be given to those who have had:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>a confirmed anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of HPV vaccine, or</span>

                            <span>a confirmed anaphylactic reaction to any components of the vaccine. </span>
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        Yeast allergy is not a contraindication to the HPV vaccine. Even though Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> is grown in yeast cells, the final vaccine product does
                        not contain any yeast (DiMiceli <em>et al</em>., 2006).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be
                        postponed until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any signs or
                        symptoms to any possible adverse effects of the vaccine.
                    </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Pregnancy and breast-feeding</div>

                    <p>
                        There is no known risk associated with giving inactivated, recombinant viral or bacterial vaccines or toxoids during pregnancy or whilst breast-feeding
                        (Atkinson <em>et al</em>., 2008). Since inactivated vaccines cannot replicate they cannot cause infection in either the mother or the foetus. However, on a
                        precautionary basis, HPV vaccine is not advised in pregnancy. If a woman finds out she is pregnant after she has started a course of HPV vaccine, she
                        should complete her pregnancy before finishing the three-dose schedule. This precaution is not due to any known risk associated with giving HPV vaccine
                        during pregnancy, but due to absence of data. Limited data are available because pregnant women were specifically excluded from clinical trials of HPV
                        vaccine. However, despite these exclusion criteria some women were inadvertently immunised whilst pregnant or shortly before becoming pregnant (many
                        pregnant women have also now been vaccinated following the introduction of HPV vaccination programmes). No specific safety concerns have been identified in
                        the women who have been given HPV vaccine, either for the outcome of pregnancy or fetal development, when compared with women who received a placebo or
                        control vaccine. Routine questioning about last menstrual period and/or pregnancy testing is not required before offering HPV vaccine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Girls aged under 18 years in the target cohort who are known to be sexually active, including those who are or who have been pregnant, may still be
                        susceptible to high-risk HPV infection and could therefore benefit from vaccination according to the UK schedule. If pregnant, they should be offered
                        vaccine as soon as possible after pregnancy. If high-risk sexual activity continues during pregnancy, and the opportunity for vaccination after pregnancy
                        is uncertain, the benefit of vaccination during pregnancy is likely to outweigh any potential risk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Termination of pregnancy following inadvertent immunisation should not be recommended. The available evidence on the use of HPV vaccine in pregnancy should
                        be discussed with the prospective parents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to the relatively limited experience of HPV vaccine in pregnant women to date, it is important to record and follow up such cases of inadvertent
                        administration during pregnancy to provide further data on the outcome. Surveillance of vaccination in pregnancy is being conducted by the Immunisation
                        Department at HPA Colindale, to whom such cases in England and Wales should be reported via the website (http://www. hpa.org.uk) or by telephone (01788
                        540298 or 0208 327 7471). Cases in Scotland should be reported to Health Protection Scotland on 0141 300 1100, Immunisation Department. Cases in Northern
                        Ireland should be reported to the Public Health Agency Duty Room (028 9055 3997).

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Immunosuppression and HIV infection</div>

                    <p>Individuals with immunosuppression or with HIV infection (regardless of CD4 count) should be considered for HPV vaccines in accordance with the recommendations above. However, individuals who are immunosuppressed may not develop a full antibody response. Clinical trials to study the effectiveness of HPV vaccination in immunosuppressed individuals are in progress. Re-immunisation should be considered after treatment is finished and/or recovery has occurred. Specialist advice may be required. </p>

                        As with all vaccines and medicines, healthcare professionals and parents/ carers are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the Medicines and
                        Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) using the Yellow Card reporting scheme (<a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard</a>).

                    <p>
                        The most common adverse reaction observed after HPV vaccine administration is mild to moderate short-lasting pain at the injection site. An immediate
                        localised stinging sensation has also been reported. Redness has also been reported at the injection site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other reactions commonly reported are headache, myalgia, fatigue, and low grade fever.

                    <p>
                        Syncope (vasovagal reaction), or fainting, can occur during any vaccination, most commonly amongst adolescents. Some individuals may also experience panic
                        attacks before vaccination. The clinical features of fainting and panic attacks are described in detail in Chapter 8 of the Green Book. Fainting and panic
                        attacks occurring before or very shortly after vaccination are not usually direct side effects (adverse reactions) of the vaccine but events associated
                        with the injection process itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only reactions suspected to be related to the vaccine (and not those associated with the injection process) should be reported via the Yellow Card Scheme.

                    <p>
                        Anaphylaxis is a very rare, recognised side effect of most vaccines and suspected cases should be reported via the Yellow Card Scheme (<a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)</a>. Chapter 8 of the Green Book gives detailed guidance on distinguishing between faints, panic attacks and the signs and symptoms of
                        anaphylaxis. If a case of suspected anaphylaxis meets the clinical features described in Chapter 8, this should be reported via the Yellow Card Scheme as a
                        case of 'anaphylaxis' (or if appropriate 'anaphylactoid reaction'). Cases of less severe allergic reactions (i.e. not including the aforementioned clinical
                        features for anaphylaxis) should not be reported as anaphylaxis but as 'allergic reaction'.
