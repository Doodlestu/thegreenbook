                    <p>
                        Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a double stranded DNA virus that infects
                        squamous epithelia including the skin and mucosae of the upper respiratory
                        and anogenital tracts. There are approximately 100 types of HPV, of which
                        about 40 infect the genital tract (McCance, 2004). Although most infections
                        are asymptomatic and self-limiting, genital infection by HPV is associated
                        with genital warts and anogenital cancers in both men ' women. HPV
                        viruses are classified as either 'high-risk' or 'low-risk’ types depending on
                        their association with the development of cancer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Genital HPVs are transmitted by sexual contact with an infected individual,
                        primarily through sexual intercourse. The risk therefore, is related to the
                        number of sexual partners, the introduction of a new sexual partner, and the
                        sexual history of any partner. Studies of incident HPV infection, based on
                        HPV DNA detection, demonstrate that acquisition of at least one type of
                        HPV infection often occurs soon after sexual debut with almost 40% of
                        women being infected within two years (Winer et al., 2003; Winer et al.,
                        2008). Infection by multiple types is common (Cuschieri <i>et al</i>., 2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of condoms reduces but does not eliminate the risk of sexual
                        transmission. Non-sexual routes of HPV transmission include vertical
                        transmission from mother to newborn baby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Persistent infection by high-risk HPV types is detectable in more than 99%
                    of cervical cancers (Walboomers <i>et al</i>., 1999). Of these high-risk types,
                    HPV16 is responsible for almost 60% and HPV18 for more than 15%, of all
                    cervical cancers in Europe (Smith <i>et al</i>., 2007). A further 11 high-risk types
                    have been described (WHO IARC, 2007)<sup>[1]</sup>. In addition to cervical cancer,
                    HPV is causally associated with less common cancers at other sites,
                    including cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis and anus, and some cancers of
                    the head and neck (Parkin <i>et al</i>., 2006; Stanley, 2007, Psyrri <i>et al</i>., 2008).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The majority of HPV infections are transient and cause no clinical problems.
                        Around 70% of new infections will clear within one year and approximately
                        90% will clear within two years (Ho <i>et al</i>., 1998; Franco <i>et al</i>., 1999). The
                        median duration of a new infection is eight months. Persistent infection by a
                        high-risk HPV type is the most important causal factor for the development of
                        cervical pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions. Persistence and disease is more
                        common for infections by HPV types 16 and 18 than for other high-risk types.
                        The time span between infection by HPV and the development of CIN3 varies
                        from one to seven years, and longer for the development of invasive cancer
                        (Moscicki <i>et al</i>., 2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The natural history of HPV-related cancers at other sites is less well understood.
                        Although high-risk HPV infection is a risk factor for the development of vaginal
                        or vulval lesions, unlike cervical cancer, only approximately 40% are associated
                        with HPV infection (Munoz <i>et al</i>., 2006). HPV infection is associated with
                        80-90% of all anal squamous cell cancers and HPV types 16 and 18 are found in
                        the majority of HPV-related anal cancers (Munoz <i>et al</i>., 2006). Around 40% of
                        cases of penile cancer are attributable to HPV infection (Rubin <i>et al</i>., 2001).
                        There is emerging evidence for an association between HPV and head and neck
                        cancers. For all sites, the evidence for a causal association is greater for HPV
                        types 16 and 18, than for other HPV types, and the majority of HPV related
                        cancers are associated with types 16 and 18.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Low-risk HPV types are responsible for genital warts, which is the most
                    commonly diagnosed viral sexually transmitted infection in the UK (Health
                    Protection Agency (HPA), 2012). HPV types 6 and 11 cause the majority of all
                    genital warts (Lacey <i>et al</i>., 2006; Garland <i>et al</i>., 2007). Genital warts appear
                    from three weeks to eight months after primary infection (most commonly two
                    to three months) (Oriel, 1971). In the absence of treatment, up to 30% of
                    individuals clear the infection in the short term (Tyring <i>et al</i>., 1998; Edwards et
                    al., 1998). The rate of spontaneous regression in the long term is not known.
                    Treatments focus on removal of the warts, but do not necessarily eliminate
                    infection, which may persist sub-clinically, and be a source of recurrence and
                    continuing viral transmission. Genital warts are not life threatening, but they can
                    cause significant morbidity. HPV 6 and 11 infection also causes laryngeal
                    papillomas, (Stamataki <i>et al</i>., 2007) an infection of the upper respiratory tract.

                        Surveillance of HPV is complex due to the high proportion of asymptomatic infections, the variable presentation of the different viral types, and the long
                        period between infection and disease.

                     A UK seroprevalence study in an unselected population showed that HPV
                    was extremely infrequent in girls aged under 14 years but HPV infections
                    rose sharply from the mid-teens. Among 10- to 29-year-old women, 11%,
                    3%, 12% and 5% had serological evidence of having been infected by HPV
                    types 6, 11, 16 or 18 respectively (Jit <i>et al</i>., 2007).

                    <p>
                        Information on the prevalence of high-risk HPV infection is available from a
                        large cross-sectional study of women having routine cervical screening in
                        England (Howell-Jones <i>et al</i>., 2010). This study found evidence of current
                        high-risk HPV infection (indicated by the presence of HPV DNA) in 29% of
                        women aged 25 to 29 years undergoing cervical screening, with prevalence
                        declining with increasing age after 30 years. Prevalence of any HPV type,
                        and particularly of HPV 16 or 18, was higher in women who had abnormal
                        cytology.

                        Information on incidence of genital warts comes primarily from people attending genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. Over 90,000 new cases of genital
                        warts were diagnosed in GUM clinics throughout the UK in 2009 (PHE, formerly the HPA, 2012). Rates of diagnoses are highest in young men and women under 24 years.

                        Cervical cancer is the second commonest cancer of women worldwide, with approximately 500,000 new cases and 270,000 deaths annually (Munoz <em>et al</em>.,
                        2006; Parkin <em>et al</em>., 2006).

                        The introduction of a national cervical screening programme in the UK has
                        made a major contribution to the fall in the incidence and death rate from
                        cervical cancer. It has been estimated that mortality rates fell approximately
                        60% between 1974 and 2004 in the UK due to cervical screening (Peto <i>et al</i>.,
                        2004).

                        The national HPV immunisation programme was introduced in September
                        2008 with all girls in school year 8 in England (aged 12 to 13 years) offered
                        vaccine against HPV infection, with a 'catch-up' campaign for girls aged
                        from 14 years to less than 18 years.

                    <p>A total of 2747 new cases of invasive cervical cancer were diagnosed in
                    England in 2009 (National Statistics, 2011). The peak incidence occurred in
                    women in their 30s with a second smaller peak in women in their 70s-80s
                    (i.e. women less likely to have benefited from cervical screening during their
                    lifetimes; Figure 18a.1). In the UK, the lifetime risk of developing cervical
                    cancer is estimated as 1 in 116 (National Statistics, 2004). In the UK,
                    approximately one third of women die within five years of the diagnosis of
                    invasive cervical cancer (National Statistics, 2011).</p>

                    <p>There are certain groups of women reported to have low cervical screening
                    rates, e.g. some ethnic minority groups and women born in foreign countries
                    (Webb <i>et al</i>., 2004; Thomas <i>et al</i>., 2005). There has also been a downward
                    trend in the number of young women taking up invitations for cervical
                    screening since the mid-1990s (NHS Cervical Screening Review, 2011).</p>
                    
                    <p>In the UK, anal cancer is rare, with around 850 cases diagnosed annually
                    (National Statistics, 2011). Overall, anal cancer is more common in women
                    than in men, but relatively high rates are found among men who have sex
                    with men. In the UK, there are around 1200 cases of vulval and vaginal
                    cancers per year.</p>

                        HPV vaccines are sub-unit vaccines made from the major protein of the viral-coat or capsid of HPV. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are prepared from
                        recombinant proteins grown in either yeast or baculovirus infected insect cells (the latter derive from a type of moth). VLPs mimic the structure of the
                        native virus but do not contain any viral DNA. There are currently two different HPV vaccine products. Cervarix<sup>&#174;</sup> contains VLPs for two HPV
                        types (16 and 18 &#8211; bivalent vaccine) and Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> contains VLPs for four HPV types (6, 11, 16 and 18 &#8211; quadrivalent vaccine).
                        The VLPs used in Cervarix<sup>&#174;</sup> are adjuvanted by AS04 containing 3-O-desacyl-4'- monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide.
                        The VLPs used in Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> are adsorbed on amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulphate adjuvant.

                        HPV vaccines are highly effective at preventing the infection of susceptible women with the HPV types covered by the vaccine. In clinical trials in young
                        women with no evidence of previous infection, both vaccines are over 99% effective at preventing pre-cancerous lesions associated with HPV types 16 or 18
                        (Harper <em>et al</em>., 2006; Ault <em>et al</em>., 2007; Lu <em>et al</em>., 2011). Current studies suggest that protection is maintained for at least
                        seven years. Based on the immune responses, it is expected that protection will be extended further; long-term follow-up studies are in place. Some other
                        high-risk HPV types are closely related to those contained in the vaccines, and vaccination has been shown to provide some cross-protection against
                        infection by these types (Brown <em>et al</em>., 2009; Lehtinen <em>et al</em>., 2012). Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> is also 99% effective at preventing
                        genital warts associated with vaccine types in young women (Barr <em>et al</em>., 2007).

                        Cervarix<sup>&#174;</sup> was the HPV vaccine offered from September 2008 to August 2012 with Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> being offered from September 2012

                    <p>In March 2014 the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation
                    (JCVI) advised that based on the latest immunological evidence (including
                    Dobson <i>et al</i>., 2013; Safaeian <i>et al</i>., 2013), the efficacy and duration of
                    protection in adolescents vaccinated using a two dose schedule administered
                    as a prime and boost (separated by a minimum of 6 months) was likely to be
                    the same as a three dose schedule. In 2013/14 both Gardasil and Cervarix</p>
                    
					<p>received licensing approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
                    for a two dose schedule in adolescent girls (Summary of Product
                    Characteristics (SPC) Gardasil, Cervarix). The two dose schedule for
                    Gardasil is licenced for individuals aged 9 to and including 13 years of age
                    and Cervarix is licenced for individuals aged 9 to and including 14 years of
                    age. JCVI has agreed, however, to recommend a 2-dose schedule up to (and
                    including) 14 years of age for both Cervarix and Gardasil. The WHO‘s
                    Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunisation also recently
                    reviewed the evidence on HPV immunisation schedules. Upon review of the
                    evidence, SAGE also recommended a 2-dose schedule for girls, if vaccination
                    is initiated prior to 15 years of age. A 3-dose schedule remains necessary if
                    immunization is initiated after the girls’ 15th birthday (WHO,2014). The two
                    dose schedule will be implemented in the UK programme for the routine
                    vaccination cohort of females aged 11 to 13 years old (academic year 8 in
                    England and Wales) from September 2014.</p>

                        Vaccines should be stored in the original packaging at +2&degC to +8&degC (ideally aim for 5&degC) and protected from light. All vaccines are
                        sensitive to some extent to heat or cold. Heat speeds up the decline in potency of most vaccines, thus reducing their shelf life. Effectiveness cannot be
                        guaranteed for vaccines unless they have been stored at the correct temperature. Freezing may cause increased reactogenicity and loss of potency for some
                        vaccines. It can also cause hairline cracks in the container, leading to contamination of the contents

                    <p>For girls aged less than 15 years of age JCVI recommended a schedule of 0,
                    6-24 months for both vaccines. For planning purposes a schedule at 0, 12
                    months is appropriate for both vaccines. Local needs, however, should be
                    considered when planning the programme. Any gap between doses of
                    between six and 24 months is clinically acceptable. As long as the first dose
                    was received before the age of 15 years the two dose schedule can be
                    followed. If the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same
                    vaccine) but not repeated, even if more than 24 months have elapsed since
                    the first dose.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whenever possible, immunisations for all individuals should follow the
                    recommended 0, 6-24 months schedule, but there is some clinical data that
                    the interval between the two doses can be reduced to five months for
                    Cervarix. For Gardasil&reg the minimum interval between the two doses should
                    be 6 months.</p>

                    Where the second dose is given late and there is a high likelihood that the
                    individual will not return for a third dose after three months or if, for
                    practical reasons, it is not possible to schedule a third dose within this

                    receive HPV vaccination as part of the national HPV immunisation programme

                    started the schedule with Cervarix,&reg but did not complete the vaccination
                    course, the course can be completed with Gardasil&reg. The course should be
                    completed according to a vaccination schedule of 0, 1, 4-6 months or 0, 6-24
                    months, depending on the age of the girl when she received the first dose and
                    whether 1 or 2 doses have already been given (see above). As there is no
                    evidence on the interchangeability of the two HPV vaccine products, this
                    advice is based on expert opinion and the high levels of antibody achieved after
                    partial courses of both vaccines.</p>
                    
                    <p>As there is no clear benefit and there are no safety data on individuals who

                    <p>As the primary purpose of the NHS immunisation programme is to protect

                    <p>Vaccines are routinely given intramuscularly into the upper arm or
                    anterolateral thigh. This is to reduce the risk of localised reactions, which are
                    more common when vaccines are given subcutaneously (Mark <i>et al</i>., 1999;
                    Zuckerman, 2000; Diggle <i>et al</i>., 2000). However, for individuals who have a
                    bleeding disorder, vaccines should be given by deep subcutaneous injection
                    to reduce the risk of bleeding.</p>
                    
                    <p>HPV vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as Td/
                    IPV, MMR, Influenza, MenC and hepatitis B. A trend of lower anti-HPV
                    titres has been observed when Gardasil&reg is administered concomitantly with
                    dTaP, dT/IPV and dTaP/IPV vaccines, though the clinical significance of this observation is unclear. The vaccines should be given at a separate site,
                    preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given
                    at least 2.5cm apart (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). The site at
                    which each vaccine was given should be noted in the individual's records.</p>

                    Scotland, and school year 9 in Northern Ireland. The move to a two dose
                    schedule in September 2014 allows flexibility around the schedule with the
                    interval between the first and second dose from 6 months to 24 months (0,
                    6-24 months) and covers girls from 11 up to and including the age of 14 years
                    (school year 8 to 9 or S1/S2 to S3 in Scotland or school year 9 to 10 in
                    Northern Ireland). The course of HPV vaccination should be administered according to the guidance given in the dosage and schedule section. If the
                    course is interrupted then it should be resumed but not repeated, ideally
                    allowing the appropriate interval between the remaining doses. For girls who
                    miss starting a course of vaccination in the first target year, those less than 15
                    years of age should still start on a two dose schedule; those aged 15 or less than

                        There are very few individuals who cannot receive HPV vaccine. Where there is doubt, appropriate advice should be sought from an immunisation coordinator
                        or consultant in health protection rather than withholding vaccination.

                        The vaccine should not be given to those who have had:

                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    <p>
                        Yeast allergy is not a contraindication to the HPV vaccine. Even though Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup> is grown in yeast cells, the final vaccine product does
                        not contain any yeast (DiMiceli <em>et al</em>., 2006).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be
                        postponed until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any signs or
                        symptoms to any possible adverse effects of the vaccine.
                    </p>

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Pregnancy and breast-feeding</div>

                    <p>
                        There is no known risk associated with giving inactivated, recombinant viral or bacterial vaccines or toxoids during pregnancy or whilst breast-feeding
                        (Atkinson <em>et al</em>., 2008). Since inactivated vaccines cannot replicate they cannot cause infection in either the mother or the foetus. However, on a
                        precautionary basis, HPV vaccine is not advised in pregnancy. If a woman finds out she is pregnant after she has started a course of HPV vaccine, she
                        should complete her pregnancy before finishing the three-dose schedule. This precaution is not due to any known risk associated with giving HPV vaccine
                        during pregnancy, but due to absence of data. Limited data are available because pregnant women were specifically excluded from clinical trials of HPV
                        vaccine. However, despite these exclusion criteria some women were inadvertently immunised whilst pregnant or shortly before becoming pregnant (many
                        pregnant women have also now been vaccinated following the introduction of HPV vaccination programmes). No specific safety concerns have been identified in
                        the women who have been given HPV vaccine, either for the outcome of pregnancy or fetal development, when compared with women who received a placebo or
                        control vaccine. Routine questioning about last menstrual period and/or pregnancy testing is not required before offering HPV vaccine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Girls aged under 18 years in the target cohort who are known to be sexually active, including those who are or who have been pregnant, may still be
                        susceptible to high-risk HPV infection and could therefore benefit from vaccination according to the UK schedule. If pregnant, they should be offered
                        vaccine as soon as possible after pregnancy. If high-risk sexual activity continues during pregnancy, and the opportunity for vaccination after pregnancy
                        is uncertain, the benefit of vaccination during pregnancy is likely to outweigh any potential risk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Termination of pregnancy following inadvertent immunisation should not be recommended. The available evidence on the use of HPV vaccine in pregnancy should
                        be discussed with the prospective parents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to the relatively limited experience of HPV vaccine in pregnant women to date, it is important to record and follow up such cases of inadvertent
                        administration during pregnancy to provide further data on the outcome. Surveillance of vaccination in pregnancy is being conducted by the Immunisation
                        Department at Public Health England (PHE) Colindale, to whom such cases in England and Wales should be reported via the website (<a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.hpa.org.uk', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">http://www.hpa.org.uk</a>) or by telephone (<a href="tel: +44 1788 540298">01788 540298</a> or <a href="tel: +44 208 327 7471">0208 327 7471</a>). Cases in Scotland should be reported to Health Protection Scotland on <a href="tel: +44 141 300 1100">0141 300 1100</a>, Immunisation Department. Cases in Northern
                        Ireland should be reported to the Public Health Agency Duty Room (028 9055 3997).

                    <div id="thirdtitle">Immunosuppression and HIV infection</div>

                    <p>There are limited data on 3 dose schedules in HIV infected populations.
                    Although the immunogenicity and efficacy of HPV vaccines may be reduced
                    in HIV infected females, they appear to be preserved (Toft <i>et al</i>., 2014).
                    Lower GMTs have been observed in HIV infected subjects compared to
                    non-HIV infected subjects of the same age for both vaccines (SPC Gardasil,
                    Cervarix). However, the clinical relevance of these observations is unknown.
                    Suboptimal immunogenicity of HPV vaccine in transplant patients has also
                    been observed (Kumar <i>et al</i>., 2013).</p>
                    
                    <p>There is no data on fewer than 3 doses among HIV-infected or
					immunocompromised populations. Therefore a 3-dose schedule should be offered to individuals who are known to be HIV-infected, including those on
                    antiretroviral therapy, or are known to be immunocompromised at the time of
                    immunization. This recommendation is endorsed by WHO SAGE.
                    Re-immunisation should be considered after treatment is finished and/or
                    recovery has occurred. Specialist advice may be required.</p>

                        The most common adverse reaction observed after HPV vaccine administration is mild to moderate short-lasting pain at the injection site. An immediate
                        localised stinging sensation has also been reported. Redness has also been reported at the injection site.

                        Syncope (vasovagal reaction), or fainting, can occur during any vaccination, most commonly amongst adolescents. Some individuals may also experience panic
                        attacks before vaccination. The clinical features of fainting and panic attacks are described in detail in Chapter 8 of the Green Book. Fainting and panic
                        attacks occurring before or very shortly after vaccination are not usually direct side effects (adverse reactions) of the vaccine but events associated
                        with the injection process itself.

                        Anaphylaxis is a very rare, recognised side effect of most vaccines and suspected cases should be reported via the Yellow Card Scheme (<a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard)</a>. Chapter 8 of the Green Book gives detailed guidance on distinguishing between faints, panic attacks and the signs and symptoms of
                        anaphylaxis. If a case of suspected anaphylaxis meets the clinical features described in Chapter 8, this should be reported via the Yellow Card Scheme as a
                        case of 'anaphylaxis' (or if appropriate 'anaphylactoid reaction'). Cases of less severe allergic reactions (i.e. not including the aforementioned clinical
